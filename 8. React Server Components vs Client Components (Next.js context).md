- **Server Components** (default in Next.js):
    
    - Execute on the **server**, not the browser.
        
    - Includes all pages, layouts, and regular components **by default**.
        
    - Ideal for reducing JavaScript sent to the client, improving performance and SEO.
        
    - Logs or actions in these components **wonâ€™t appear in the browser console**, but instead in the server terminal.
        
- **Client Components**:
    
    - Still **pre-rendered** on the server but contain logic that **must run on the client** (browser).
        
    - Required for using:
        
        - **React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
            
        - **Event handlers** (e.g., `onClick`)
            
        - Anything that needs **browser-side interactivity**.

#### **2. Making a Component a Client Component**

- Add `"use client"` directive **at the top of the file**.
    
- This enables use of client-only features like:
    
    - React hooks
        
    - DOM interactions
        
    - Browser APIs
        
- Without this directive, using client-only features will **throw errors**.

#### **3. Benefits of Server Components in Next.js**

- **Less client-side JS â†’ Better performance**.
    
- **SEO benefits**:
    
    - HTML sent to the browser already contains all the rendered content.
        
    - This helps **search engines crawl content** directly.
        
    - Unlike Vanilla React where HTML is mostly empty until JavaScript loads.

## âœ… **Navigation Highlight (Active Link Styling)**

### Problem:

- Your **header links werenâ€™t showing active state** (no visual cue for which page you're on).
    

### Solution:

1. **Used `usePathname()` from `next/navigation`** to get the current URL path.
    
2. **Conditionally applied the `active` class** to highlight the correct nav link.
    
3. **Moved this logic into a new `NavLink` component** instead of bloating the `MainHeader`:
    
    - Created `components/NavLink.js` and `nav-link.module.css`.
        
    - Made `NavLink` a **client component** (via `'use client'`) since `usePathname()` only works on the client.
        
    - Passed `href` and `children` props to `NavLink` to make it reusable.
        
    - Added logic to **highlight the link if the path matches** or starts with a given prefix.
        
    - Reused the `active` and `link` classes from the original header CSS.

## âœ… **Performance Optimization**

- Instead of converting the entire `MainHeader` to a client component, you **isolated client-side logic to just `NavLink`**.
    
- This keeps the bulk of your app **rendered on the server**, which is better for:
    
    - SEO
        
    - Performance
        
    - Scalability

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- **Modularization** is critical â€” moving small pieces of logic into their own files keeps things clean and scalable.
    
- **Minimize client components** â€” keep your app performant by only making parts client-side when necessary.
    
- **usePathname() is client-only**, so isolate its use carefully.
