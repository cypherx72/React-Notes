Here are concise, forward-looking notes on setting up a 404 “Page Not Found” handler in Express:

---

## 1. Why You Need a 404 Middleware

- Any request that doesn’t match **any** of your defined routes should get a proper “not found” response.
    
- Without it, Express will simply hang or return a generic error.

## 2. How Express Processes Requests

1. Express runs your middleware/routes **in declaration order**, top to bottom.
    
2. If a route handler **sends a response** (e.g., `res.send()`), the chain stops—no further middleware runs.
    
3. If a route handler calls `next()` (or you never send a response), Express moves on to the next middleware.
    
4. If **no** middleware ever sends a response, the request reaches the end of your stack—and that’s where your 404 handler goes.

## 3. Implementing the Catch-All 404 Handler

Place this **at the very bottom** of your `app.js`, **after** all other routes and routers:

```js
// Catch-all for unmatched routes
app.use((req, res) => {
  res
    .status(404)               // Set HTTP status code
    .send(`
      <h1>Page Not Found</h1>
      <p>The resource you requested does not exist.</p>
    `);                        // Send simple HTML response
});
```

- **`app.use(...)`** without a path matches _every_ method and path.
    
- **`res.status(404)`** sets the status code before sending.
    
- **Chaining**: Express lets you chain `status()`, `set()`, etc., ending with `send()` (or `json()`, `end()`, etc.).

## 4. Best Practices & Next Steps

- **Custom 404 Pages:** Replace the inline HTML with a rendered template or static file for better UX.
    
- **Error-Handling Middleware:** Later in the course, you’ll learn the special `(err, req, res, next)` signature for catching runtime/server errors (500s).
    
- **Order Matters:** Always register your 404 handler **after** all other routes and middleware.
    
- **Modularization:** You can also extract your 404 handler into its own module and mount it last:
    
    ```js
    const notFound = require('./middleware/notFound');
    app.use(notFound);
    ```
    

With this in place, any unknown URL will gracefully return your custom 404 page. Up next: crafting a global error handler to catch and display server-side errors (500s).
