### 🔁 **Problem: Middleware Runs for All HTTP Methods**

You began with:

```js
app.use('/some-path', middleware);
```

This executes for **every HTTP method** (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, etc.) hitting `/some-path`.

So, when you're only trying to handle, say, a POST submission—`app.use()` is too broad. It's like casting a net into the ocean when you just want to catch one kind of fish.

---

### ✅ **Solution: Use Method-Specific Routing**

Instead of `app.use()`, you switch to:

```js
app.post('/some-path', middleware);
```

This filters by **method + path**—which is more efficient and more secure. Now your route only activates for actual POST requests to `/some-path`.

Likewise:

- `app.get()` handles GETs
    
- `app.post()` handles POSTs
    
- `app.put()`, `app.patch()`, `app.delete()` — all valid HTTP methods

### 🧠 **Scaling Up: Splitting Routes**

**Why split routes into separate files?**

- **Maintainability** – Keeping everything in `app.js` gets messy fast.
    
- **Modularity** – You want separation of concerns: admin routes vs user/shop routes, etc.
    

So you create:

- `routes/admin.js`
    
- `routes/shop.js`
    

Each exports a `router` using:

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router(); // Mini express app

// Routes
router.get('/add-product', handler);
router.post('/product', handler);

// Export
module.exports = router;
```

Then in `app.js`, you import and mount them:

```js
const adminRoutes = require('./routes/admin');
const shopRoutes = require('./routes/shop');

app.use('/admin', adminRoutes);
app.use(shopRoutes); // Mounts at root level
```

Now:

- A GET request to `/admin/add-product` triggers the `admin.js` route.
    
- A GET to `/` triggers the `shop.js` route.

### ⚠️ **Important Insight: Order Matters**

Routing in Express is **first match wins**.

So:

```js
app.use('/admin', adminRoutes);
app.use(shopRoutes);
```

This ensures admin routes are prioritized over general shop routes.

But if you were to switch to `app.use()` instead of `app.get()`, and you place the `shopRoutes` _above_ the `adminRoutes`, you might unintentionally hijack admin route traffic. That's why even if it works now with `app.get()`—you’re **better off ordering it properly from the beginning**.

---

### 🔄 TL;DR Summary

- `app.use()` runs for _all methods_ — overkill unless you’re handling general middleware.
    
- Use `app.get()`, `app.post()` for **method-specific routing**.
    
- Modularize routes using `express.Router()` — cleaner and scalable.
    
- **Order of routes matters** — first match wins, especially with `app.use()`.
    
- Mount routers with base paths: `app.use('/admin', adminRoutes)`.
