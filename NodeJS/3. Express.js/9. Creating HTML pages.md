## 1. Introducing a `views/` Folder

- **Purpose:** Keep all your presentation-layer files (HTML templates) in one place.
    
- **Convention:** You’ll later tie this into an MVC pattern—models, views, controllers—for clear separation of concerns.

## 2. Creating Your HTML Files

- **`views/add-product.html`**
    
    - Starts with a standard HTML5 skeleton (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
        
    - `<header>` with a `<nav>`: links back to the shop (`/`) and the add-product page (`/add-product`).
        
    - `<main>` containing the `<form action="/admin/add-product" method="POST">` (you’ll update the action to include your mount path).
        
    - Inside the form: a text `<input name="title">` plus a `<button type="submit">`.
        
- **`views/shop.html`**
    
    - Same header/nav boilerplate for consistent navigation.
        
    - `<main>` with an `<h1>My Products</h1>` placeholder—later you’ll inject a dynamic list here.

## 3. Why This Matters

- **Maintainability:** HTML lives separately from your JavaScript logic.
    
- **Reusability:** Shared header/nav can be broken into partials once you adopt a templating engine.
    
- **Scalability:** As your app grows, you’ll add more “view” files (e.g., product-details, edit-product) in this same folder.

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Serving These Files:**
    
    - Use `res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'add-product.html'))` (or equivalent) in your route handlers.
        
2. **Templating Engine Integration:**
    
    - Swap static HTML for EJS, Pug, Handlebars, etc., to render dynamic data.
        
3. **Styling & Assets:**
    
    - Introduce a `public/` folder for CSS, images, and serve them via `express.static()`.
        
4. **Controller Organization:**
    
    - Move your `res.sendFile()` calls into controller functions for cleaner route files.
