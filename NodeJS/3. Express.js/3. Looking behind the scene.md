### 1. Exploring the Source on GitHub

- **Why peek under the hood?**
    
    - Helps you understand default behaviors and decide when you need to override them.
        
    - Empowers you to implement custom logic if a built-in helper doesn’t cover your use case.
        
- **Where to look:**
    
    - `lib/response.js` for all the `res.*` helpers (like `.send()`, `.json()`, etc.)
        
    - `lib/application.js` for the high-level `app.listen()` abstraction.

### 2. How `res.send()` Really Works

1. **Type detection**
    
    - Checks whether your payload is a string, buffer, JSON-able object, boolean, number, etc.
        
2. **Default headers**
    
    - If you haven’t set `Content-Type` manually:
        
        - **Strings** → `text/html; charset=utf-8`
            
        - **Buffers** → `application/octet-stream`
            
        - **Objects/Arrays** → `application/json; charset=utf-8`
            
3. **Conditional header setting**
    
    - Only sets the header if it’s not already present, so your custom overrides stick.
        

> **Why this matters:** you no longer need to manually call `res.setHeader()` or deal with chunked `.write()` boilerplate for most common cases.

### 3. The `app.listen()` Convenience Method

- **Under the hood:**
    
    1. Calls `http.createServer(app)`
        
    2. Invokes `.listen()` on that server
        
- **Benefits:**
    
    - Removes two lines of boilerplate (`import http`, `http.createServer(app).listen(...)`)
        
    - Keeps your setup focused on your application logic
        
- **Usage:**
    
    ```js
    import express from 'express';
    const app = express();
    // define middleware & routes…
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server running on port 3000');
    });
    ```

### 4. Why Understanding Internals Is Worthwhile

- **Customization:** If you ever need a tweak—like handling a bespoke content type or altering default error pages—you know exactly where to patch or extend.
    
- **Debugging:** When something doesn’t behave as expected (e.g., headers not showing), you can trace through the source rather than blindly guessing.
    
- **Confidence:** You’re not treating Express as a black box; you know its guarantees and limitations.
