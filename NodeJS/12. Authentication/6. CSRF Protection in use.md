## 🛡️ CSRF Protection in Express Apps

### 📌 What is CSRF?

- **CSRF** stands for **Cross-Site Request Forgery**.
    
- It's a **security vulnerability** where a malicious site tricks a logged-in user into making unintended requests to your server.
    
- This exploits the **user’s valid session** to perform unwanted actions like:
    
    - Transferring money.
        
    - Making a purchase.
        
    - Changing account settings.
        

### ⚠️ How Does It Work?

1. User is logged into your site.
    
2. Malicious site sends a `POST` request to your backend.
    
3. Browser includes **session cookies** automatically, authenticating the request.
    
4. Since there's no way to differentiate between a real request and a forged one, the server accepts it—unless protected.

## 🧰 How to Prevent CSRF Attacks

### ✅ Use a CSRF Token

- A **CSRF token** is a **random string** tied to the user’s session.
    
- The server **generates this token** and **renders it into the frontend** (e.g., in a form).
    
- When the form is submitted, the token must be sent along with it.
    
- Server checks:
    
    - Does the token exist?
        
    - Does it match the one stored in the session?
        
- If **invalid or missing**, the request is **rejected**.

## ⚙️ Implementation with `csurf`

### 1. **Install the Package**

```bash
npm install --save csurf
```

### 2. **Setup in `app.js`**

```js
const csrf = require('csurf');

// Init the CSRF middleware (defaults to using session)
const csrfProtection = csrf();

// After setting up session middleware
app.use(session(...));
app.use(csrfProtection);
```

> 🔒 `csurf` must be used **after session middleware** because it relies on session storage.

---

### 3. **Add CSRF Token to Views**

#### Example: Passing CSRF Token to EJS

In a controller like `getIndex`:

```js
res.render('shop/index', {
  csrfToken: req.csrfToken()
});
```

#### Example: EJS Form Usage

```html
<form action="/logout" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="<%= csrfToken %>">
  <button type="submit">Logout</button>
</form>
```

> ✅ The input **must be named `_csrf`** — this is the default name `csurf` expects.

---

### 4. 💥 What Happens If Token Is Missing?

- `csurf` middleware throws an error: **"invalid csrf token"**.
    
- This protects against requests that **lack a valid token**, like those sent by external fake sites.
    

---

## 🔄 Make Token Available to All Views

Rather than passing `csrfToken` manually in every render call:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.locals.csrfToken = req.csrfToken();
  next();
});
```

Now in **any view**, you can use:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="<%= csrfToken %>">
```

> Bonus: You can do the same for `isAuthenticated` or other frequently-needed globals using `res.locals`.

Here’s a **structured and simplified breakdown of the notes** based on your transcript, covering how **CSRF protection** was added and how to apply it across all views effectively in an Express.js app.

### 🔐 CSRF Protection with `csurf` in Express.js

---

### ✅ Why CSRF Protection is Important

- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks can trick users into submitting requests using their authenticated session.
    
- `csurf` prevents this by requiring a secret **CSRF token** with any state-changing requests (e.g. POST, PUT, DELETE).
    

---

### 📦 Step 1: Install `csurf`

```bash
npm install csurf
```

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Integrate `csurf` Middleware in `app.js`

1. **Import and configure `csurf`**:
    
    ```js
    const csrf = require('csurf');
    const csrfProtection = csrf(); // using default (session-based) storage
    ```
    
2. **Use after session middleware**:
    
    ```js
    app.use(session({ ... })); // Your session config here
    app.use(csrfProtection);   // Must come *after* the session
    ```
    

---

### 🌍 Step 3: Make `csrfToken` and `isAuthenticated` available globally to all views

Use Express’s `res.locals` object:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.locals.isAuthenticated = req.session.isLoggedIn;
  res.locals.csrfToken = req.csrfToken(); // Provided by csurf middleware
  next();
});
```

> ✅ This avoids the need to manually pass these values in every `res.render()` call.

---

### 🧾 Step 4: Use the CSRF Token in All POST Forms

Add a **hidden input field** in every form that triggers a non-GET request:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="<%= csrfToken %>">
```

💡 This field **must** be named `_csrf` for the `csurf` middleware to recognize it.

#### 🔄 Places to include the token:

- **Login / Signup Forms**
    
- **Add to Cart Form**
    
- **Delete Product / Cart Item Forms**
    
- **Order Button**
    
- **Any admin form that posts data**
    
- **Logout button form**
    

---

### 🚨 Common Pitfalls

- If CSRF token is **missing** from a POST form, the request will be rejected with an **"Invalid CSRF token"** error.
    
- Token must be included **only in forms that submit via POST, PUT, DELETE**, not on simple GET links.
    

---

### 🛡️ Final Result

- Every route now has access to `csrfToken` and `isAuthenticated`.
    
- All necessary forms include the hidden CSRF token input.
    
- Protection is automatic: `csurf` checks the token on each non-GET request.
    

---

### 🔥 Key Takeaway

> **CSRF protection is not optional** in production-grade applications. Without it, your authenticated sessions can be hijacked via forged requests.

This setup ensures your app is safe from a major class of attacks with minimal overhead.
