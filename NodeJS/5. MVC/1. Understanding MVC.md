## ðŸ“Œ Module Topic: MVC (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller) Pattern

---

### 1. **What Is MVC?**

- **MVC** stands for **Model**, **View**, **Controller**.
    
- Itâ€™s a **separation of concerns** pattern ensuring each layer has a distinct responsibility.
    

---

### 2. **Models**

- Represent and manage **data and business logic**.
    
- Handle tasks like:
    
    - Fetching/saving data (to files, databases, or in-memory storage).
        
    - Defining data structures and validation rules.
        
- **Example in this course:** The `products` array and any future database wrappers.
    

---

### 3. **Views**

- Responsible for **presentation**: generating the HTML sent to the user.
    
- Use **templating engines** (EJS, Pug, Handlebars) to inject dynamic data.
    
- Completely **decoupled** from business logic; only cares about rendering.
    

---

### 4. **Controllers**

- Act as the **bridge** between Models and Views.
    
- Contain the **application logic**:
    
    - Receive HTTP requests (via routes).
        
    - Invoke Model methods to retrieve or update data.
        
    - Pass data to Views for rendering.
        
- Keep Views and Models unaware of each otherâ€™s internal workings.
    

---

### 5. **How Routes Fit In**

- **Routes** map **HTTP methods & URLs** to **Controller functions**.
    
- In Express:
    
    ```js
    router.get('/shop', shopController.getShop);
    router.post('/add-product', productController.postAddProduct);
    ```
    
- Each controller method then:
    
    1. Calls Model operations.
        
    2. Calls `res.render()` (or `res.json()`) to produce a View.
        

---

### 6. **Benefits of MVC**

- **Maintainability:** Clear file/folder structure.
    
- **Testability:** Isolated units (models, views, controllers).
    
- **Scalability:** Easy to add features without tangled code.
    
- **Collaboration:** Frontend (Views) and backend (Models/Controllers) teams can work in parallel.
    

---

### 7. **Next Steps**

- **Refactor** existing code into MVC folders:
    
    ```
    /models
      product.js
    /controllers
      shop.js
      admin.js
    /routes
      shop.js
      admin.js
    /views
      includes/
      shop.ejs
      add-product.ejs
      404.ejs
    ```
    
- Move business logic into **Models**, route-handling logic into **Controllers**, and keep Views purely for rendering.
