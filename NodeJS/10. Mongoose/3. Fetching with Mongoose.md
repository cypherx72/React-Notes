## 🛍️ Fetching Products with Mongoose – `getProducts` & `getIndex`

### 📂 File: `controllers/shop.js`

---

### ✅ Goal:

- Implement `getProducts` and `getIndex` controllers to **fetch all products** from the MongoDB database using **Mongoose**.
    

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:

- **Mongoose does not provide a `fetchAll()`** method.
    
    - That was a **custom method** in previous setups.
        
- Instead, Mongoose exposes a **static `.find()`** method on models.
    

---

### 🔍 Using `.find()` in Mongoose:

```js
Product.find()
  .then(products => {
    console.log(products); // Array of product objects
    // Return/render/send as needed
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

- Unlike the **native MongoDB driver**, Mongoose's `.find()`:
    
    - Returns a **fully resolved array**, not a **cursor**.
        
    - If a **cursor** is needed:
        
        ```js
        Product.find().cursor();
        ```
        
        - Use `.eachAsync()` or `.next()` for iteration.

### 📦 `getProducts` Controller:

- Fetch all products using `.find()`.
    
- Log/return/render them.
    

```js
exports.getProducts = (req, res, next) => {
  Product.find()
    .then(products => {
      console.log(products); // Check data in console
      res.render('shop/product-list', {
        prods: products,
        pageTitle: 'All Products',
        path: '/products'
      });
    })
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
};
```

---

### 🏠 `getIndex` Controller:

- Same logic, different route (homepage).
    

```js
exports.getIndex = (req, res, next) => {
  Product.find()
    .then(products => {
      res.render('shop/index', {
        prods: products,
        pageTitle: 'Shop',
        path: '/'
      });
    })
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
};
```

---

### 🧪 Testing:

- After saving everything, navigate to:
    
    - `/products` ➜ to test `getProducts`
        
    - `/` ➜ to test `getIndex`
        
- Both should render with fetched product data.
    

---

### ⚠️ Performance Tip:

- `.find()` retrieves **all documents**.
    
    - Use **pagination or filters** if the collection is large.
        
    - This is covered in the **pagination module** later.
        

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Working `getProducts` and `getIndex` routes using Mongoose.
    
- Next step: Implement the **detail route** for a single product (`getProductById`).
