Here are **structured notes** based on your transcript, summarizing the key concepts and actions regarding setting up a **Mongoose schema and model for products**:

# üõ† Resetting MongoDB and Setting Up Mongoose

## üîÑ Resetting the MongoDB Database (Using Compass)

- Initially connected with a **read/write restricted user**, which couldn't delete the database.
    
- Workaround: **Deleted collections** manually from the `shop` database.
    
- MongoDB will **recreate the database and collections automatically** once new data is inserted.

# üß± Defining a Product Schema with Mongoose

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Import Mongoose

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
```

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Create a Schema Constructor

```js
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
```

- `Schema` is a constructor function used to define the **shape of documents** within a collection.
    

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Define the Product Schema

```js
const productSchema = new Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  price: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  imageUrl: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  }
});
```

### üîç Notes:

- MongoDB is **schema-less** by default ‚Äî but Mongoose allows you to **opt-in** to a schema-based structure.
    
- This helps with:
    
    - Data validation
        
    - Consistent structure
        
    - Easier querying and logic in the app
        
- The `_id` field (of type `ObjectId`) is automatically created; **no need to define it manually**.

## ‚úÖ Why Use Schemas in MongoDB?

- MongoDB itself is **flexible**, but that can lead to **inconsistencies**.
    
- In real-world apps, having a schema:
    
    - Prevents missing or invalid fields (e.g., a missing `title`)
        
    - Avoids runtime errors when rendering or processing data
        
- Mongoose lets you **enforce structure** and still retain flexibility if needed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Example: Simple vs Detailed Schema Definition

### Simple:

```js
title: String
```

### Detailed:

```js
title: {
  type: String,
  required: true
}
```

## üìù Product Schema Fields

|Field|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`title`|String|‚úÖ|Name/title of the product|
|`price`|Number|‚úÖ|Price of the product|
|`description`|String|‚úÖ|Text description of the product|
|`imageUrl`|String|‚úÖ|URL to the product image|

---

## üîú Next Steps

- Create a **Mongoose model** based on the `productSchema`.
    
- Use the model to **create, save, and query product documents** in the MongoDB collection.
