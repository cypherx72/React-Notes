## 🔐 What is a Cookie?

### 📌 Definition:

A **cookie** is a **small piece of data** stored **on the client-side (browser)** by the server. It allows the server to remember **stateful information** across **multiple HTTP requests**, such as whether a user is logged in.

---

## 🧭 Real-World Scenario: Login Flow

### 🧑‍💻 Setup:

- **Client**: A user interacts with a webpage rendered using EJS templates (or any other templating engine).
    
- **Server**: Node.js application running Express.
    

### 👣 Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **User submits a login form**:
    
    - Sends an HTTP POST request to the server with credentials.
        
2. **Server verifies credentials**:
    
    - If valid, the server wants to remember that this user is now **logged in**.
        
3. **Server sends a response**:
    
    - Along with a view redirect (e.g., redirect to `/dashboard`), the server **attaches a cookie** to the HTTP response.
        
4. **Cookie is stored in the browser**:
    
    - Browser stores the cookie in local memory associated with the domain.
        
5. **Subsequent requests include the cookie**:
    
    - On future requests (page reloads, new views, etc.), the browser **automatically sends** the cookie back to the server.
        
6. **Server reads the cookie**:
    
    - The server checks the cookie to verify that the user is authenticated (e.g., session ID, JWT, etc.).

## 🍪 Purpose of Cookies

- **Session Management**: Track logged-in users across page reloads.
    
- **Personalization**: Store user preferences, themes, etc.
    
- **Tracking**: Identify repeat visitors (e.g., for analytics).
    

---

## ⚠️ Important Characteristics

- **Stored on the client** (browser).
    
- Can be **read by the server** on each request.
    
- Are **automatically included** in every HTTP request by the browser (if set with the correct domain/path/secure flags).

## 🛠️ Practical Usage in Node.js

In a Node.js app (e.g., Express):

```js
res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'isLoggedIn=true');
```

Or using a library like `cookie-parser`:

```js
app.use(require('cookie-parser')());

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  // if login is successful
  res.cookie('isLoggedIn', true);
  res.redirect('/dashboard');
});
```

And later:

```js
app.get('/dashboard', (req, res) => {
  if (req.cookies.isLoggedIn) {
    res.render('dashboard');
  } else {
    res.redirect('/login');
  }
});
```

## ✅ Summary

- A **cookie** is a simple way to store data in the **browser**.
    
- The **server sets** a cookie during a response.
    
- The **browser sends** the cookie back on future requests.
    
- This mechanism allows **persistent login**, **session handling**, and **state tracking** across stateless HTTP requests.

### 🔐 What Is a Cookie? (Concept & Use Case)

- **Cookies** are small pieces of data **stored on the client (browser)**.
    
- They're sent **by the server** and can be **automatically included in future requests** by the browser.
    
- Cookies help **maintain state** across requests, which is otherwise lost due to HTTP's stateless nature.
    

---

### 🧭 Scenario: Storing Login State

- We have a **login form** rendered with **EJS** in our Node.js application.
    
- On **form submission**, we send a `POST /login` request to the server.
    
- The goal: **"Remember"** that the user is logged in even **after redirecting** to another page.
    

---

### 🧪 Initial Approach (Flawed)

- In the `postLogin` controller:
    
    ```js
    req.isLoggedIn = true;
    res.redirect('/');
    ```
    
- In the views (e.g. `navigation.ejs`), render links conditionally:
    
    ```ejs
    <% if (isAuthenticated) { %>
      <!-- Authenticated UI -->
    <% } %>
    ```
    
- In every `res.render(...)` call across the app, pass:
    
    ```js
    isAuthenticated: req.isLoggedIn
    ```
    

---

### 🧨 Why This Doesn't Work

- HTTP requests are **one-time**: once a response is sent, that `req` object is **discarded**.
    
- On redirect (`res.redirect('/')`), a **new request** is made to the server.
    
- `req.isLoggedIn` only lives for the **current request** and doesn’t carry over.
    
- So on the new request, `req.isLoggedIn` is `undefined` → `isAuthenticated` is `false`.
    

---

### 🌐 Why Requests Are Isolated

- Every request is **completely separate**:
    
    - Even multiple requests from the **same user/IP** are treated **independently**.
        
    - This design improves **security and scalability**.
        
- Sharing state across requests must be **explicit**, either by:
    
    - Sending data in the **browser** (like cookies).
        
    - Using **sessions** or **tokens** that persist across requests.
        

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Request-based data (`req.something`) is **ephemeral** — gone after the response.
    
- Use **cookies or sessions** to persist state **across** multiple requests.
    
- That’s why authentication, user preferences, or shopping carts use cookies/sessions.
