Perfect—this transcript is essentially explaining **how to migrate a React frontend from using REST API requests to using GraphQL mutations** for user signup. Let’s break it into **clean, structured notes** for your Obsidian or study material:

---

# 🚀 Connecting React Frontend to GraphQL Backend (User Signup)

## 📌 Context

- Initially, the frontend (React app) was sending **REST API POST requests** to create a user.
    
- Now the backend exposes **only a GraphQL endpoint (`/graphql`)**, so the frontend must use GraphQL queries/mutations.
    

---

## 📝 Steps to Update Signup Handler

### 1️⃣ Replace REST API with GraphQL Mutation

- REST API call in `app.js` → replaced with a **GraphQL mutation**.
    
- **GraphQL Query Object:**
    
    - Create a new constant, e.g., `graphqlQuery`.
        
    - Must include a `query` key (even for mutations).
        
    - Use template literals (`` ` ``) for multi-line GraphQL syntax.
        

```js
const graphqlQuery = {
  query: `
    mutation {
      createUser(userInput: {
        email: "${email}",
        name: "${name}",
        password: "${password}"
      }) {
        _id
        email
      }
    }
  `
};
```

> 💡 **Note:** Inject user input values (`email`, `name`, `password`) dynamically into the mutation string using `${}` inside backticks.

### 2️⃣ Update `fetch` Request

- Send POST request to `/graphql`.
    
- Headers:
    
    ```js
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    ```
    
- Body:
    
    ```js
    body: JSON.stringify(graphqlQuery)
    ```
    

---

### 3️⃣ Error Handling in GraphQL Response

- GraphQL always responds with **HTTP 200** (even on errors).
    
- Errors are included in the response body under `errors` key.
    
- Check for validation or creation errors:
    

```js
if (responseData.errors) {
  const firstError = responseData.errors[0];
  if (firstError.status === 422) {
    throw new Error('Validation failed.');
  }
  throw new Error('User creation failed.');
}
```

---

### 4️⃣ Handle CORS Preflight Requests (OPTIONS)

- Browsers send an **OPTIONS request** before POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE (preflight check).
    
- `express-graphql` only supports **POST** and **GET** → rejects OPTIONS.
    
- Solution:  
    Add middleware in backend to respond to OPTIONS requests:
    

```js
if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
  return res.sendStatus(200); // Respond OK and exit
}
```

> ✅ Prevents OPTIONS requests from reaching `/graphql`.

## 🎯 Testing the Signup Flow

1. Run frontend: `npm start`
    
2. Access on `localhost:3000`
    
3. Navigate to **Signup Page**.
    
4. Try signing up:
    
    - Existing email → should get “Validation failed” error.
        
    - New email → should succeed.
        
5. Check GraphQL response:
    

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createUser": {
      "_id": "...",
      "email": "newuser@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- GraphQL requires **POST** requests to a single endpoint `/graphql`.
    
- Use a `query` key in the request body for both **queries** and **mutations**.
    
- Handle CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) explicitly in the backend.
    
- Check errors in the response body, not HTTP status codes.
