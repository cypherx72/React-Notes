### üëÄ What We‚Äôre Doing Now

- Before we start fetching the product from the database **inside our Node.js application**, the instructor wants to **introduce a tool** for **viewing the data visually**.
    

---

### üîß Tool: Compass

- You can **download Compass** from the official MongoDB website (mongodb.com) by clicking **Get MongoDB**.
    
- Compass is **available for Windows, macOS, and Linux**.
    
- After installing it, you can **launch the Compass application** on your machine.
    

---

### üí° What Compass Does

- Compass is a **graphical user interface (GUI)** tool.
    
- It lets you **connect to your database** and **interact** with it visually.
    
- You don‚Äôt need to use command-line tools to browse your data.
    

---

### üîå Connecting Compass to Your Database

1. Go back to your **MongoDB cluster**.
    
2. Click **Connect**.
    
3. Then choose **‚ÄúConnect with MongoDB Atlas.‚Äù**
    
4. Choose your **operating system** and **copy the connection string**.
    

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Auto-Detection Feature

- If you **close Compass** after copying the connection string and **reopen it**, Compass will **detect that connection string**.
    
- If it asks whether to use the detected string, click **Yes**.
    
- It will auto-fill the necessary fields for you.
    

---

### üîê Authentication Required

- You still need to:
    
    - **Select your username** (it should already be correct),
        
    - **Manually enter the password** for that user.
        
- The rest of the settings can be left to default.
    

---

### üìÇ Viewing the Database

- After a successful connection, you‚Äôll see:
    
    - The **database server**.
        
    - A couple of **default databases** (these are system databases you should not touch).
        
    - Your own database ‚Äî e.g., `shop`.
        

---

### üóÉÔ∏è Inside the `shop` Database

- Inside the `shop` database, you‚Äôll find a **collection called `products`**.
    
- Clicking into it, you can **view the documents** stored there.
    
- You‚Äôll see the **product document** we inserted in the last lecture.
    

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Extra Compass Features (Mentioned Briefly)

- You can **insert** and **edit documents** directly within Compass.
    
- For more features, you‚Äôre encouraged to check the **official Compass documentation**.
    

---

### üéØ Purpose of Using Compass Here

- The instructor‚Äôs goal is just to provide a **visual confirmation** that the data was inserted correctly.
    
- This helps **see the data** before fetching it in the app.
    

---




You're now at a crucial and rewarding point ‚Äî **you‚Äôve verified the data is inside MongoDB using Compass**, which confirms the **insert operation works perfectly**. Next up: **read and display that data back in your app**, completing the second pillar of CRUD: **Read (R)**.

---

## üîç Step-by-Step: Fetch and Display Products from MongoDB

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Add `fetchAll()` in Your Product Model

Add this method in your `Product` class (`models/product.js`):

```js
const getDb = require('../util/database').getDb;
const { ObjectId } = require('mongodb');

class Product {
  // ... existing constructor & save()

  static fetchAll() {
    const db = getDb();
    return db.collection('products')
      .find()
      .toArray()  // returns a promise resolving to array of products
      .then(products => {
        return products;
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.log(err);
      });
  }

  // Optional later: findById(id), deleteById(id), etc.
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Re-enable the `/admin/products` Controller

Update your controller (`controllers/admin.js`):

```js
const Product = require('../models/product');

exports.getProducts = (req, res, next) => {
  Product.fetchAll()
    .then(products => {
      res.render('admin/products', {
        prods: products,
        pageTitle: 'Admin Products',
        path: '/admin/products'
      });
    })
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
};
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Re-enable the `/admin/products` Route

In your `routes/admin.js`:

```js
const adminController = require('../controllers/admin');

router.get('/products', adminController.getProducts);
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Ensure Your View is Set Up

Make sure your `views/admin/products.ejs` (or `.pug`, etc.) is still set up to iterate over `prods`:

**Example using EJS:**

```ejs
<% if (prods.length > 0) { %>
  <ul>
    <% for (let prod of prods) { %>
      <li><%= prod.title %> - ‚Çπ<%= prod.price %></li>
    <% } %>
  </ul>
<% } else { %>
  <p>No products found.</p>
<% } %>
```

---

## üîÅ Final Test

1. Start your server (`node app.js` or however you're running it).
    
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin/products` in your browser.
    
3. You should **see your product(s) listed**!

## üß† Pro Tips

- MongoDB stores `_id` as an object (`ObjectId`) ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to handle that for things like editing or deleting.
    
- You can **extend this to `findById`**, `deleteById`, and `updateById` now that your data model is fully functional.
    
- Compass will remain your **go-to visual inspector** while developing. Use it when debugging insertions, updates, or deletes.
    

---

Let me know when you want to proceed with:

- Implementing `findById()` for editing
    
- Adding `deleteProduct`
    
- Or even wiring up the user again with `userId` in each product
    

You're back in control of your app‚Äôs data ‚Äî and MongoDB is playing nice.
