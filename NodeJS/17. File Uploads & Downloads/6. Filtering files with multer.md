Here‚Äôs a clear and structured breakdown of your Multer **file filtering logic** from the transcript, turned into developer-friendly notes.

## üìÅ **Multer File Filtering Notes**

### ‚úÖ **Goal**

Only allow image uploads (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`) and **reject other file types** like `.pdf`.

---

### üîß **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### 1. **Create a File Filter Function**

This function lets you programmatically decide if a file should be stored.

```js
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (
    file.mimetype === 'image/png' ||
    file.mimetype === 'image/jpg' ||
    file.mimetype === 'image/jpeg'
  ) {
    cb(null, true); // ‚úÖ Accept the file
  } else {
    cb(null, false); // ‚ùå Reject the file
  }
};
```

- `file.mimetype` is used to check the file type.
    
- `cb(null, true)` ‚Üí Accept file.
    
- `cb(null, false)` ‚Üí Reject file silently (no error thrown by default).
    

---

#### 2. **Attach File Filter in Multer Config**

Update your Multer configuration to include the `fileFilter`:

```js
const upload = multer({
  storage: fileStorage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
});
```

---

#### 3. **Resulting Behavior**

- Valid uploads like `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` ‚Üí accepted and stored.
    
- Invalid files like `.pdf`, `.exe`, `.gif` ‚Üí **rejected silently** (no file stored).
    
- `req.file` becomes `undefined` if the file is rejected.
    
- You must check for `req.file` before accessing its properties.
    

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caveat: Undefined Errors**

When an invalid file is uploaded:

- `req.file` is `undefined`
    
- Any code like `req.file.path` will throw: **"Cannot read property of undefined"**
    

‚úÖ Use:

```js
if (!req.file) {
  return res.status(422).json({ message: 'Unsupported file type' });
}
```

---

### üßº **Post-Step Cleanups (As per transcript)**

- Delete previously uploaded invalid files.
    
- Clean up any dangling or incorrect DB entries related to those uploads.
    
- Store file info only when valid uploads happen.

## üß† Summary

|Feature|What It Does|
|---|---|
|`fileFilter`|Accepts/rejects files based on MIME type|
|`.mimetype` check|Ensures only images are accepted|
|`req.file === undefined`|When Multer rejects a file|
|Error handling|You must manually send an error message|

---

Let me know if you want to automatically **send a custom error message** when a file is rejected ‚Äî that requires modifying the callback to `cb(new Error(...), false)` and setting up an Express error handler.
