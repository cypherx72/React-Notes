Here‚Äôs a **compact and structured set of notes** summarizing the key points from this transcript on handling file uploads in the backend using **Multer**:

---

### üîÅ **Context Recap**

- Frontend now has a **file input** (`<input type="file" name="image">`) for uploading images when adding a product.
    
- Backend currently **fails** to extract this image file because it is not equipped to handle **binary data** (files).
    

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why the Current Setup Fails**

- In `admin.js`, form validators (e.g., checking for a valid image URL) still expect a **text URL**, not a file ‚Äî this causes validation errors.
    
- The request parser used (`body-parser.urlencoded`) is for **URL-encoded form data only** (i.e., plaintext), and it **cannot parse files**.
    
- Submitting a file still sends `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, which is incorrect for file data.

### üõ†Ô∏è **What Needs to Change**

#### 1. **Remove Invalid Validators**

- Remove `isURL()` validator on `imageUrl` in the route file (`routes/admin.js`), since we now expect a **file** not a URL.
    

#### 2. **Install and Use Multer**

- Multer is a middleware designed for **handling `multipart/form-data`** (used for file uploads).
    
- Install via:
    
    ```bash
    npm install --save multer
    ```
    

#### 3. **Update Form Encoding**

- In your EJS form (`edit-product.ejs`), set the form's `enctype`:
    
    ```html
    <form ... enctype="multipart/form-data">
    ```
    
- This tells the browser to send **text and binary data**, which Multer can then parse properly.

### üß† **How Multer Helps**

- It extracts both:
    
    - **Text fields** (like title, price, description)
        
    - **File fields** (like the uploaded image)
        
- It attaches the file data to `req.file` or `req.files` (depending on the upload strategy).

### ‚úÖ **Next Step (Preview)**

In the next lecture, Multer will be:

- Configured in `app.js` as middleware.
    
- Used in the `adminController.js` to extract and store uploaded files.
    
- Possibly set up with disk storage to save images to a folder like `/images`.
