Here's a **short and structured summary** of the key points from the transcript on file uploads in Node.js (Express app):

---

### ‚úÖ **Why File Uploads?**

- Current form uses a **URL input for image**, which is unrealistic.
    
- In real-world apps, users should be able to **upload local images** (not just paste URLs).
    
- Goal: Allow users to **upload product images** from their device.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Steps for File Upload Implementation**

#### 1. **Update the Form (Frontend - EJS Template)**

- Navigate to: `views/admin/edit-product.ejs`.
    
- Locate the **image URL input block**.
    
- Comment out the existing input (URL).
    
- Replace it with a **file input**:
    
    ```html
    <input type="file" name="image" id="image">
    ```
    
- Remove:
    
    - `value` attribute (pre-filling a file input is not allowed).
        
    - Any conditional CSS classes (e.g., for invalid input highlighting).
        
- Result: Form now allows file selection through a **native file picker**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- The form **only collects the file** at this point.
    
- No backend logic exists _yet_ to:
    
    - Handle the file.
        
    - Store the file.
        
    - Validate the file type or size.
        
- If the user tries to submit now, it will **fail**.

### ‚û°Ô∏è **Next Steps (Backend - Upcoming Lecture)**

- Implement logic to:
    
    - **Accept the file** on the server.
        
    - **Store** it in the filesystem or cloud.
        
    - Handle file vs. text inputs in request handling.

Let me know if you want notes on handling the backend side with `multer` or any file processing middleware.
