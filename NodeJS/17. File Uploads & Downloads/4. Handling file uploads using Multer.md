Here are your **concise developer notes** based on this transcript, focusing on integrating **Multer** into a Node.js backend for handling file uploads:

## 🛠️ Multer Integration – Step-by-Step

### ✅ 1. **Install & Import Multer**

- Already installed with:
    
    ```bash
    npm install --save multer
    ```
    
- In `app.js`, import it:
    
    ```js
    const multer = require('multer');
    ```
    

---

### 📥 2. **Basic Multer Setup**

- Add as middleware **after** body-parser:
    
    ```js
    app.use(multer({ dest: 'images' }).single('image'));
    ```
    
- `dest: 'images'` means files will be **stored on disk** in the `images/` folder.
    
- `.single('image')` refers to the `name="image"` in your `<input>` field.
    

---

### ⚙️ 3. **What Multer Does**

- Automatically parses incoming `multipart/form-data` (required for file uploads).
    
- Extracts file and puts it on `req.file` (not `req.body`).
    
- You must add this to your form in EJS:
    
    ```html
    <form enctype="multipart/form-data" ...>
    ```

### 📦 4. **What Gets Logged in `req.file`**

After submission, `req.file` looks like:

```js
{
  fieldname: 'image',
  originalname: 'photo.png',
  encoding: '7bit',
  mimetype: 'image/png',
  destination: 'images/',
  filename: 'randomhash',
  path: 'images/randomhash',
  size: 12345
}
```

- If you don’t specify a destination, you get a `buffer` in memory instead.
    
- With `dest`, multer **writes to disk** and omits the buffer.
    

---

### 🚫 5. **Why It Still Fails (For Now)**

- The controller still tries to handle `req.body.image` as a URL.
    
- But the upload **does work** — file is saved in `/images`.
    
- The saved file has:
    
    - A **random filename**
        
    - **No extension**
        
- But it’s the correct binary content.

### ✅ Next Steps (Teased for Next Lecture)

- **Customize filename and path**
    
- Possibly:
    
    - Add file extension
        
    - Rename uploaded files
        
    - Store filename in DB instead of full image path

## 🧠 Summary

|Thing|Where It Goes|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Form Data (`multipart`)|`req.body`|Text fields only|
|Uploaded File|`req.file`|Use `.single('image')`|
|File Storage|`/images/` folder|Via `dest: 'images'` option|
|File Naming|Random by default|Will customize next|
