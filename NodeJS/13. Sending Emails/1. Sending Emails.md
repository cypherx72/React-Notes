## 📧 **How Sending Emails Works in Node.js (Conceptual Overview)**

### 🔍 **Common Misconception**

> **Node.js and Express.js** are used for **handling server-side logic**, **not for sending emails directly.**

- Node **cannot** function as a mail server by itself.
    
- Email servers (SMTP) are a **separate and complex system**, entirely different from HTTP request/response handling.
    

---

### 🏗️ **Why Not Build Our Own Mail Server?**

- Building a secure, scalable mail server is **extremely complex**.
    
- You'd need to handle:
    
    - SMTP protocol
        
    - Email queueing
        
    - Throttling/rate limiting
        
    - Authentication & spam prevention (e.g., DKIM, SPF)
        
    - Deliverability and IP reputation
        

> ⚠️ **Even major companies like Udemy use third-party services** like:

- **AWS SES**
    
- **SendGrid**
    
- **Mailgun**
    
- **Postmark**
    
- **SMTP2GO**
    

---

### 💡 **Practical Approach**

- We use a **third-party email service** to send emails from our app.
    
- Node.js acts as a **client** to that service.
    

---

### 🧪 **What's Next in the Module**

- You’ll learn how to **integrate** with such a service (e.g., SMTP or API-based) to send emails.
    
- Focus will be on:
    
    - Configuring an SMTP transport (via packages like `nodemailer`)
        
    - Sending email through a third-party provider
        
    - Possibly using templates (HTML emails)
        
    - Handling errors/logging

## 🚀 Summary

|✅ What Node Can Do|❌ What Node Can’t Do|
|---|---|
|Use `nodemailer` to send email via SMTP or API|Act as a full mail server (SMTP host)|
|Integrate with services like SendGrid or Mailgun|Handle direct mail routing & delivery|
|Send automated emails (e.g., signup confirmations)|Guarantee email deliverability on its own|
