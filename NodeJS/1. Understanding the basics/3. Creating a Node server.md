### 🔧 Step-by-Step Breakdown: Creating a Simple Node.js Server

#### 1. **Create a file called `app.js`**

This is your server's entry point—think of it like the “main” file of your backend.

#### 2. **Import the `http` module**

```js
const http = require('http');
```

- `require` is Node’s way to import modules.
    
- No path (`./`) means Node looks for **core modules**, like `http`.
    

#### 3. **Create a request listener function**

This handles all incoming HTTP requests.

```js
const requestListener = (req, res) => {
  console.log(req); // You’ll see all request details here
};
```

You can use any of:

- Named functions
    
- Anonymous functions
    
- Arrow functions ← cleanest in modern JS
    

#### 4. **Create the server**

```js
const server = http.createServer(requestListener);
```

#### 5. **Start listening on a port**

```js
server.listen(3000);
```

- This keeps the process alive.
    
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` to trigger the server.

### 💡 What Happens Behind the Scenes

- When you visit `localhost:3000`, your browser makes a request.
    
- Your server receives it and runs the callback (`requestListener`).
    
- You're logging the entire `req` object to the console.
    
- You're **not yet** sending any response back, which is why the browser “hangs”.
    

---

### ✅ Minimal Working Example

Here’s the entire thing in a clean format:

```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log(req); // inspect this to learn what’s inside
  res.end('Hello from Node.js server!');
});

server.listen(3000);
```

Now if you visit `http://localhost:3000`:

- You’ll see `"Hello from Node.js server!"` in the browser
    
- And the request info logged in your terminal

### 🧠 Mental Model Shift: You're Building the Server

In traditional setups (e.g., PHP, Apache), the server is prebuilt and you just “plug into it.”  
With Node.js:

- **You** define what the server is and how it responds.
    
- This gives **total control** but requires you to explicitly handle every detail (headers, routes, etc.).
    

---

### 🚀 What's Next

Now that you've got a working server:

- Learn to **send custom responses** (headers, status codes).
    
- Handle different **routes** (e.g., `/`, `/about`, `/api`).
    
- Eventually transition to frameworks like **Express.js** to simplify boilerplate.

## 🔄 The Node.js Event Loop

1. **Single-Threaded Execution**
    
    - Node.js runs your JavaScript on a **single thread**. It does **not** spawn a new thread per request.
        
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
    
    - Instead of blocking on I/O or waiting for work, Node uses an **event loop**:
        
        - It continuously checks for **pending events** (like incoming HTTP requests, database callbacks, timers).
            
        - When an event occurs, it dispatches your **registered callback** (e.g., your `createServer` listener).
            
3. **Long-Running Listeners**
    
    - Calling `http.createServer(listener)` registers a **persistent event listener** for HTTP requests.
        
    - As long as that listener exists, the event loop keeps the process alive—your server stays up.
        
4. **Graceful Shutdown**
    
    - If you ever call `process.exit()`, you **force** the process to stop, bypassing the event loop.
        
    - Normally you **don’t** do that in production, since you want your server to keep listening.
        
5. **Why This Matters**
    
    - **High Concurrency**: One thread + non-blocking I/O + event loop → can handle thousands of simultaneous connections efficiently.
        
    - **Avoid Blocking**: Never do long, synchronous operations on the main thread, or you’ll block the event loop and stall all requests.
        

---

### 🚀 Next Steps

- **Inspect `req` and `res` objects** to read request details and send back responses.
    
- **Learn non-blocking patterns** (callbacks, Promises, `async/await`) so you don’t block the event loop.
    
- **Move on to frameworks** (like Express) that build on these event‑driven basics and simplify routing and middleware.
