You're now wrapping up one of the most essential foundational concepts in Node.js: **modularization using CommonJS** (`require`, `module.exports`, and `exports`). Here's a clean summary of what you've learned and implemented — distilled and structured so you walk away with confidence:

---

## ✅ What You Just Did

### 🔹 Split Logic into Separate Files

- You moved all your routing logic out of `app.js` into a new file: `routes.js`
    
- This makes your code **cleaner, easier to maintain, and scalable**
    

### 🔹 Created a Request Handler Function

- Defined a function `requestHandler(req, res)` to handle routing.
    
- Exported it using `module.exports`.
    

```js
// routes.js
const fs = require('fs');

const requestHandler = (req, res) => {
  // your if logic and routing here
};

module.exports = requestHandler;
```

- Then in `app.js`, you used it like:
    

```js
const http = require('http');
const routes = require('./routes');

const server = http.createServer(routes);
server.listen(3000);
```

> This is a **single export setup**, passing one function.

---

## 🔁 Alternative: Multiple Exports

### 🔸 Option 1: Export an Object

```js
module.exports = {
  handler: requestHandler,
  someText: "Hardcoded string"
};
```

### 🔸 Option 2: Use Properties on `module.exports`

```js
module.exports.handler = requestHandler;
module.exports.someText = "Hardcoded string";
```

### 🔸 Option 3: Use `exports` Shortcut

```js
exports.handler = requestHandler;
exports.someText = "Hardcoded string";
```

Then, in `app.js`:

```js
const routes = require('./routes');

http.createServer(routes.handler).listen(3000);
console.log(routes.someText);
```

## 💡 Key Concepts to Lock In

### ✅ Node.js Caches Required Modules

- Modules are only loaded once (cached) — re-requiring the same file doesn’t re-run it.
    
- Modifications to an imported module's exported object must be done **inside that module**, or explicitly exposed via functions.
    

### ✅ `require()` Looks for:

1. **Core modules** (like `http`, `fs`)
    
2. **Node modules**
    
3. **Relative/local files** (like `./routes`)
    

### ✅ `module.exports` is the export **object**

- You can assign:
    
    - A function directly
        
    - An object containing multiple properties
        
    - Or mutate it by adding properties one by one

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Splitting your code into modules is **non-negotiable** in real-world Node.js apps. You'll:

- Keep your code DRY and organized.
    
- Be able to reuse and test functionality easily.
    
- Work more effectively in teams and on larger projects.

## 🔚 Conclusion

You now understand:

- How to structure Node.js apps using modules.
    
- The different ways to export/import logic.
    
- How to isolate routing logic from server bootstrap code.
    

This modular foundation sets the stage for Express.js, file-based routers, middlewares, and scalable architectures.

When you're ready, the **next step** is typically:

**→ Introducing Express.js**  
So you don’t have to manually parse URLs and handle routing logic with if-else blocks.
