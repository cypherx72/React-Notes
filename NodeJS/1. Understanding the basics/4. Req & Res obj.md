## 📥 The `request` Object (`req`)

This object is created by Node.js and passed into your `createServer` callback like this:

```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log(req.url, req.method, req.headers);
});

server.listen(3000);
```

### ✅ Key Properties You Typically Use

|Property|What It Gives You|
|---|---|
|`req.url`|The URL path of the request (e.g. `/`, `/test`, `/api/data`)|
|`req.method`|The HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)|
|`req.headers`|Metadata sent by the client (browser, API client, etc.)|

### 🧠 Example Output on `/test`

If you visit `http://localhost:3000/test`:

```js
/test GET {
  host: 'localhost:3000',
  connection: 'keep-alive',
  ...more headers
}
```

- `url`: `/test`
    
- `method`: `GET`
    
- `headers`: Many auto-sent by the browser, like `Accept`, `User-Agent`, `Cookie`, etc.

## ⚠️ Why This Matters

- These three fields help you **route** and **process** requests based on URL, method, or header content.
    
- You can inspect headers to check:
    
    - Content types (`Content-Type`)
        
    - Authorization tokens (`Authorization`)
        
    - Cookies (we’ll get into these later)

## 🔜 What’s Next: Sending a Response

You’ve only been logging incoming data. Now it’s time to respond to it using the `res` object.

Here's a sneak peek:

```js
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
res.write('<h1>Hello from Node.js!</h1>');
res.end();
```

You’ll learn to:

- Set HTTP headers on the response
    
- Write and send response data
    
- End the response (very important — `res.end()` finalizes it)

Request & Response Headers

On both requests and responses, Http headers are added to transport metadata from A to B.

The following article provides a great overview of available headers and their role: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

Whilst this article is a great resource, especially to dive deeper, please **don't learn this list by heart** though! You'll encounter many of these headers throughout the course and I'll explain them when we need them.

---

## 1. Read the Request URL

```js
const url = req.url;
```

- `req.url` gives the path (e.g. `/`, `/message`, `/whatever`).
    

---

## 2. Basic Routing with `if`

```js
if (url === '/') {
  // serve the form page
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
  res.end(`...your HTML...`);
  return;  // stop further handling for this request
}
```

- Use **strict** `===` to match both type and exact string.
    
- Always `return` after `res.end()` so you don’t accidentally fall through and send multiple responses.

## 3. Serving an HTML Form

Inside the `/` route you send back:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Enter Message</title></head>
<body>
  <form action="/message" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="message">
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

- `<form action="/message" method="POST">` tells the browser to issue a **POST** request to `/message`, including any `<input name="...">` values.
    

---

## 4. Testing

1. Restart the server (`CTRL+C`, then `node app.js`).
    
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` → you should see the text box and “Send” button.
    
3. Hitting “Send” will POST to `/message` (which you haven’t handled yet).
    

---

### Next Steps

- Add an `else if (url === '/message' && req.method === 'POST')` branch.
    
- In that branch, **collect the POST body**, parse out the `message` field, and **save** it (e.g. to a file).
    
- Then send back a redirect or confirmation response.
    

That will complete your round-trip: **serve form → receive data → process it → respond**.



You're now wiring together **form submission → file writing → redirect**, which is fundamental full-stack behavior. Here's a breakdown of what you're doing and where you're headed:

---

## ✅ What You Just Did (Summary)

1. **Handled the POST request to `/message`**:
    
    ```js
    if (url === '/message' && method === 'POST') {
        // logic here...
    }
    ```
    
2. **Wrote to a file using the `fs` module**:
    
    ```js
    const fs = require('fs');
    fs.writeFileSync('message.txt', 'Dummy text');
    ```
    
3. **Redirected the user using a 302 response**:
    
    ```js
    res.writeHead(302, { Location: '/' });
    return res.end();
    ```
    

---

## ⚠️ But Right Now...

You're writing **dummy text**, not the real form input. That means:

- You **haven’t parsed the POST body** yet.
    
- You **need to extract the actual message** from the request payload.
    

---

## 🛠️ What Comes Next: Parsing the Form Data

Unlike frameworks like Express, the **Node.js core `http` module** does **not automatically parse** the body of a POST request. You'll need to:

### Step 1: Collect the POST body data

```js
const body = [];

req.on('data', (chunk) => {
  body.push(chunk);
});

req.on('end', () => {
  const parsedBody = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
  const message = parsedBody.split('=')[1]; // crude parsing for single input
  fs.writeFileSync('message.txt', message);
  res.writeHead(302, { Location: '/' });
  return res.end();
});
```

- `req.on('data')`: collects incoming chunks
    
- `req.on('end')`: fires when all data has been received
    
- `Buffer.concat(body).toString()`: converts Buffer array to a string
    
- `parsedBody.split('=')[1]`: gets the actual message (assuming only 1 input field)
    

---

## 💡 What the Body Might Look Like

If you submitted the form with:

```html
<input name="message" value="hello">
```

The parsed body string will be:

```
message=hello
```

Hence:

```js
const message = parsedBody.split('=')[1];
```

If you're dealing with multiple fields or want robust parsing, consider using the `querystring` module:

```js
const qs = require('querystring');
const parsedData = qs.parse(parsedBody);
const message = parsedData.message;
```

---

## ✅ Final Flow (Without Express):

1. GET `/` → serve HTML form
    
2. POST `/message` → extract `message` field
    
3. Write it to `message.txt`
    
4. Redirect to `/`
    

---

### 🚀 You're One Step from a Working Full-Stack Cycle.

Once you've wired up the parsing logic in `req.on('end')`, your basic Node.js web server will be _actually interactive_ — not just responding, but handling input and doing something with it.
