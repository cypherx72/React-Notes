## 1. Purpose of Databases

- **Store data** efficiently for fast access and querying
    
- Avoid reading entire files; handle growing data volumes
    

---

## 2. SQL Databases

1. **Data Model**: Relational tables
    
    - Tables (e.g., `users`, `products`, `orders`)
        
    - Rows = records; Columns = fields (ID, name, price, etc.)
        
2. **Strong Schema**
    
    - Each table’s columns and types are strictly defined
        
    - All records must conform to schema
        
3. **Relations**
    
    - Define associations between tables:
        
        - **One-to-One**
            
        - **One-to-Many**
            
        - **Many-to-Many**
            
    - Example: an `orders` table links `users` and `products`
        
4. **Query Language**
    
    - SQL = Structured Query Language
        
    - Standard keywords (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.)
        
    - Example:
        
        ```sql
        SELECT * 
        FROM users 
        WHERE age > 28;
        ```

## 3. NoSQL Databases

- **Non-relational**, schema-flexible stores
    
- Data often stored as documents (e.g., JSON), key-value pairs, column-families, or graphs
    
- **MongoDB** is a popular document-store example
    
- Allows dynamic or evolving schemas (fields can vary per document)

## 4. Key Trade-Offs

|Aspect|SQL|NoSQL|
|---|---|---|
|Schema|Fixed, strictly enforced|Flexible or schema-less|
|Relations|First-class support via JOINs and foreign keys|Manual embedding or application-level joins|
|Query language|Standardized SQL|Varies by engine (e.g., MongoDB’s query API)|
|Scalability|Typically vertical (scale-up)|Often horizontal (scale-out)|
|Use cases|Complex transactions, strong consistency|Large-scale, flexible data models|

## 5. When to Choose Which

- **SQL** if you need:
    
    - Strong data integrity and ACID transactions
        
    - Structured, interrelated data with complex joins
        
- **NoSQL** if you need:
    
    - Rapidly evolving data models
        
    - High write/read throughput at scale
        
    - Flexible or hierarchical data (e.g., nested JSON)
