### 🛠️ 3. Initial State of Data Handling

- Currently:
    
    - Data (e.g. product title) is **fetched** but only **logged**.
        
    - No persistent storage (no database yet).
        
    - Goal: **Start managing that data**, even temporarily.
        

---

### 🧠 4. In-Memory Storage Using JavaScript Variables

- Add a `products` array in `admin.js`:
    

```js
const products = [];
```

- Even though `products` is a `const`, we can still **push** elements into it (mutating the contents, not reassigning).
    
- Add new product title into `products`:
    

```js
products.push({ title: req.body.title });
```

---

### 📤 5. Exporting Data from Module

- Changed export format to:
    

```js
exports.routes = router;
exports.products = products;
```

- This allows both the `router` and the shared `products` array to be used elsewhere.
    

---

### 📥 6. Importing in `app.js`

- Update the `import`:
    

```js
const adminData = require('./routes/admin');
app.use('/admin', adminData.routes);
```

- Now `adminData.products` is accessible elsewhere (e.g., in `shop.js`).
    

---

### 🔍 7. Using the Shared Data in `shop.js`

- Import the shared module:
    

```js
const adminData = require('./routes/admin');
console.log("shop.js", adminData.products);
```

- On page reload:
    
    - Initially: `[]` (empty array).
        
    - After form submission: contains product (`{ title: 'Book' }` etc.).
        

---

### 🔄 8. Server-Wide Data Sharing Behavior

- This shared `products` array:
    
    - Exists **in-memory** on the Node.js server.
        
    - Is **shared across all users and requests**.
        
- If user A submits a product, user B **also sees it**.
    
- Even across different browsers (e.g. Chrome vs Firefox), the data persists across sessions.
    

---

### 🚨 9. Risks and Drawbacks

- **⚠️ Not suitable for production:**
    
    - Shared state across users is almost always undesirable.
        
    - Could expose **personal or sensitive** data to others.
        
    - Data is lost if server restarts.
        
- For now, okay for **learning and prototyping**.
    

---

### 🔜 10. What’s Next

- Plan to extend the form with more fields (beyond just `title`).
    
- Later in the course:
    
    - Learn **database integration** for permanent storage.
        
    - Learn to scope data **per user/session** (rather than sharing globally).

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|In-Memory Storage|Use of server-side variables (e.g. `products[]`) for temporary data sharing|
|Module Exports|Exporting multiple values (router + data array) from a single module|
|Server-Wide State|Node.js data can be shared across all users if not handled carefully|
|Avoid in Production|This technique is okay for testing, but unsafe for real-world apps|
