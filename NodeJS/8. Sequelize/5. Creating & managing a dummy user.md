Here’s how you can leverage the `req.user` you’ve injected to create products that are automatically tied to that user:

---

## 1. Middleware: Attach `user` to `req`

You’ve already added this in **`app.js`** _after_ your initialization but _before_ your routes:

```js
// app.js (after sequelize.sync().then(...))
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Guaranteed to exist because we created/fetched it at startup
  User.findByPk(1)
    .then(user => {
      req.user = user;    // a Sequelize instance
      next();
    })
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
});
```

---

## 2. Define the Association

Make sure in **`app.js`** you have:

```js
// import at top:
const Product = require('./models/product');
const User    = require('./models/user');

// association setup:
Product.belongsTo(User, { constraints: true, onDelete: 'CASCADE' });
User.hasMany(Product);
```

This tells Sequelize:

- **`userId`** FK lives on the `products` table.
    
- You can call **`user.createProduct()`** or **`product.setUser()`**.
    

---

## 3. Use `req.user.createProduct()` in Your Controller

In **`controllers/admin.js`**, update your `postAddProduct` to use the associated-creation method instead of `Product.create()`:

```js
exports.postAddProduct = (req, res, next) => {
  const { title, price, imageUrl, description } = req.body;

  // This will automatically set userId = req.user.id
  req.user
    .createProduct({
      title: title,
      price: price,
      imageUrl: imageUrl,
      description: description
    })
    .then(product => {
      console.log('Created Product for User:', product);
      res.redirect('/admin/products');
    })
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
};
```

### Why this works:

- **`req.user`** is a Sequelize model instance of `User`.
    
- **`user.createProduct()`** is added by Sequelize because of the `hasMany`/`belongsTo` association.
    
- Sequelize will insert the new product **with `userId = req.user.id`** under the hood.

## 4. Verify in the Database

1. Add a new product via your form.
    
2. In MySQL Workbench, refresh the `products` table.
    
3. You should see a new row with the correct `userId` column matching your dummy user’s ID (`1`).
    

---

With these changes, every product created via your admin route will be correctly associated to the logged-in (dummy) user. Next up, you can use **`product.getUser()`** or **`user.getProducts()`** to query these relationships.
