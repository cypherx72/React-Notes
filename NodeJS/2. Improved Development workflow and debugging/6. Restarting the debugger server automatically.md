## 🔍 Debugging Node.js Apps in VS Code — Key Concepts & Setup

### 🛠️ Basic Debugging Capabilities

- **Breakpoints**: You can set breakpoints to pause code execution at specific lines.
    
- **Debug Console**:
    
    - Can run JavaScript code live while paused at a breakpoint.
        
    - Access and interact with **variables in current scope** (e.g. `message`, `parsedBody`).
        
    - Useful for **trying transformations or operations** without changing the actual code.

### ⚙️ Configuring VS Code to Restart Debugger Automatically

By default, **debugger does not restart** when files are changed. To fix this:

#### Step-by-Step:

1. **Create Debug Configuration**:
    
    - Go to the _Run and Debug_ panel.
        
    - Click **"Add Configuration"** and choose **Node.js**.
        
    - This creates a `.vscode/launch.json` file.
        
2. **Edit `launch.json` to use `nodemon`**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug with Nodemon",
      "runtimeExecutable": "nodemon",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js",
      "restart": true,
      "console": "integratedTerminal"
    }
    ```
    
    - `runtimeExecutable: "nodemon"` → Runs with nodemon instead of plain Node.
        
    - `program` → Always starts from `app.js`, regardless of which file is open.
        
    - `restart: true` → Automatically restarts debugger on file changes.
        
    - `console: "integratedTerminal"` → Logs output to terminal, not debug console.
        
3. **Install Nodemon Globally**:
    
    - Required because the debugger uses the global version:
        
        ```bash
        npm install -g nodemon
        ```
        
    - On Mac/Linux:
        
        ```bash
        sudo npm install -g nodemon
        ```

### 📌 Tips & Observations

- **Output Differences**:
    
    - The **debug console** can still be used to inspect and interact with values.
        
    - However, logs and restart behavior are handled in the **integrated terminal**.
        
- **Process Management**:
    
    - Stop the `nodemon` process manually with `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
        
    - You can't kill it from the debug console — they are separate.

### ✅ Summary: Why This Setup Matters

|Feature|Benefit|
|---|---|
|Breakpoints|Pause and inspect execution|
|Debug Console|Run real-time code for variables|
|Nodemon + Debugger|Auto-restart on file changes|
|Integrated Terminal|Better process & log control|

### 🧠 Final Thought

> For everyday development, you might prefer `npm start` for simplicity. But use this enhanced debugger setup when diagnosing tricky bugs or inspecting specific logic.
