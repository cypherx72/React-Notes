This video transcript is explaining the **use of `npm init` and `npm scripts` in a Node.js project** — a foundational part of working with Node.js efficiently, especially as projects grow.

Here's a concise breakdown of the key takeaways and the **purpose of each step**:

---

### 🔧 Problem Before:

You're starting your app with:

```bash
node app.js
```

every time. While not painful, it's repetitive and not scalable.

---

### ✅ Solution: Use `npm` and `package.json`

#### Step 1: Initialize `package.json`

```bash
npm init
```

This sets up a `package.json` file — the configuration hub for your Node.js project.

#### Step 2: Add a `start` script

In `package.json`, modify the `scripts` section like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js"
}
```

Now, instead of:

```bash
node app.js
```

You can run:

```bash
npm start
```

✅ **Benefits:**

- Shorter to type.
    
- Convention: anyone cloning your project can just run `npm start`.
    
- Easily scalable: later you'll hook in tools like `nodemon`, `webpack`, or testing libraries.

### 🎯 Bonus: Add custom scripts

Example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js",
  "start-server": "node app.js"
}
```

Then run it with:

```bash
npm run start-server
```

**Note:** You must use `npm run <script-name>` for all custom scripts. Only `"start"` and `"test"` are special — they can be run directly like `npm start`.

---

### ⚙️ Real-World Usage

In React, Vue, Angular, etc., you see scripts like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test"
}
```

And in backend projects:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon app.js",
  "start": "node app.js",
  "lint": "eslint ."
}
```

---

### 📦 Summary:

Using `npm init` and `scripts` helps you:

- Avoid repetitive typing.
    
- Standardize how your app is started or built.
    
- Lay the foundation for automation (build, test, deploy).
    

Global Features vs Core Modules vs Third-Party Modules

The last lectures contained important concepts about available Node.js features and how to unlock them.

You can basically differentiate between:

- **Global features**: Keywords like const or function but also some global objects like process
    
- **Core Node.js Modules**: Examples would be the file-system module ("fs"), the path module ("path") or the Http module ("http")
    
- **Third-party Modules**: Installed via `npm install` - you can add any kind of feature to your app via this way
    

**Global features** are **always available**, you don't need to import them into the files where you want to use them.

**Core Node.js Modules** don't need to be installed (**NO** `**npm install**` is required) but you **need to import them** when you want to use features exposed by them.

Example:

`const fs = require('fs');`

You can now use the `fs` object exported by the "fs" module.

**Third-party Modules** **need to be installed** (via `npm install` in the project folder) **AND imported**.

Example (which you don't need to understand yet - we'll cover this later in the course):

1. // In terminal/ command prompt
2. npm install --save express-session

3. // In code file (e.g. app.js)
4. const sessions = require('express-session');
