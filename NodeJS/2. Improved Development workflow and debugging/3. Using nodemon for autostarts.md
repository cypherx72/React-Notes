You're now entering one of the most important productivity phases in your Node.js development workflow — using `nodemon` to automate restarts on file changes. Let's summarize **what just happened** and **why it's powerful**, then **what to do next**.

---

### ✅ What Just Happened

1. **Installed `nodemon` as a dev dependency**
    
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev nodemon
    ```
    
    This means it's only needed during development (not production).
    
2. **Updated your `package.json`**
    
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "nodemon app.js"
    }
    ```
    
    This tells npm to use `nodemon` instead of `node` when running the app. `nodemon` monitors file changes and auto-restarts the server.
    
3. **Now when you run**
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    
    - It boots up your app like `node app.js` would.
        
    - It **watches** for file changes.
        
    - On save, it **automatically restarts** your app — no more `Ctrl+C` + `npm start`.

### 🔥 Why This Is a Game-Changer

- **Faster iteration:** You can test changes instantly.
    
- **Fewer mistakes:** Forgetting to restart the server is no longer an issue.
    
- **Cleaner workflow:** More focus on coding logic, less on tooling overhead.

### ⚙️ Under the Hood

- `nodemon` watches files with extensions like `.js`, `.json`, `.mjs` by default.
    
- It sits in `node_modules/.bin/nodemon` and npm scripts are smart enough to find it.
    
- If you ever want to run it from CLI directly (outside of npm scripts), install globally:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g nodemon
    ```

### 🧠 Pro Tips

- You can customize what files/folders `nodemon` watches:
    
    ```bash
    nodemon --watch src app.js
    ```
    
    or with a `nodemon.json` config file:
    
    ```json
    {
      "watch": ["src"],
      "ext": "js,json",
      "ignore": ["*.test.js"]
    }
    ```
    
- Add **more scripts**:
    
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "nodemon app.js",
      "start": "node app.js"
    }
    ```
    
    Now use `npm run dev` for development and `npm start` for production.

### 🚀 What's Next?

In the upcoming module, you're going to:

- Start using **Express.js**, the most popular Node framework.
    
- Likely introduce **Body Parser** or similar to handle incoming request data.
    
- Use **middleware** and **routing** to handle different endpoints cleanly.
    

Global & Local npm Packages

In the last lecture, we added `nodemon` as a local dependency to our project.

The good thing about local dependencies is that you can share projects **without the node_modules** folder (where they are stored) and you can run `npm install` in a project to then re-create that node_modules folder. This allows you to share only your source code, hence reducing the size of the shared project vastly.


I showed that `nodemon app.js` would **not work** in the terminal or command line because we don't use local dependencies there but global packages.

You could install `nodemon` globally if you wanted (this is NOT required though - because we can just run it locally): `npm install -g nodemon` would do the trick. Specifically the `-g` flag ensures that the package gets added as a global package which you now can use anywhere on your machine, directly from inside the terminal or command prompt.
