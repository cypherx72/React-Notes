### 1. **Syntax Errors**

> 💥 These are like grammar mistakes in your code.

- **What causes them?**
    
    - Missing `}` or `)`, incorrect keywords, misplaced commas, etc.
        
    - Examples:
        
        ```js
        const name = "Cypher_X // ❌ missing closing quote
        function sayHi( {   // ❌ unexpected token
        ```
        
- **How to spot them?**
    
    - Instantly flagged by the interpreter/compiler.
        
    - Your terminal will refuse to run the code and throw a clear message.
        
- **Fix?**
    
    - Read the error message carefully.
        
    - Modern IDEs (like VS Code) highlight them as you type — **use that to your advantage**.

### 2. **Runtime Errors**

> 🚫 These only show up _after_ your code successfully compiles and tries to run.

- **What causes them?**
    
    - Accessing undefined variables, bad function calls, or failed operations.
        
    - Example:
        
        ```js
        const data = undefined;
        console.log(data.name); // ❌ TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
        ```
        
- **How to spot them?**
    
    - Your app crashes _after_ starting.
        
    - The terminal stack trace is your best friend here.
        
- **Fix?**
    
    - Read stack traces top-to-bottom.
        
    - Use `console.log()` or `debugger` to trace values step-by-step.

### 3. **Logical Errors**

> 🧠 These are the sneaky ones — your code runs, but **does the wrong thing**.

- **What causes them?**
    
    - Incorrect conditions, wrong calculations, flawed logic.
        
    - Example:
        
        ```js
        function isAdult(age) {
          return age < 18; // ❌ logic flipped!
        }
        ```
        
- **How to spot them?**
    
    - No crash, no red flags — just unexpected results.
        
    - Test cases fail, or app behaves oddly.
        
- **Fix?**
    
    - Use **manual testing**, **unit tests**, and tools like:
        
        - `console.log()`
            
        - **Node.js debugger**
            
        - IDE breakpoints
            
        - Testing frameworks like Jest

Expect errors. Embrace them. Learn from the trace.  
This module will sharpen your problem-solving instincts like crazy if you lean in.

You're doing great — keep building that dev muscle.You're now diving into a **crucial concept for every developer**: understanding and handling **different types of errors**. Here's a clear, structured breakdown of what was discussed and what you should take away from it:
