Got it âœ… You want clean **notes** out of that transcript. Iâ€™ll structure them into a clear outline, cutting the repetitions, while keeping the important details.

# ðŸ“˜ Notes on Stack Data Structure

## 1. Introduction

- **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO principle** (Last In, First Out).
    
- Insertion and deletion are restricted to one end only â†’ called **Top** of the stack.
    
- Everyday analogy:
    
    - Cars parked in a dead-end lane.
        
    - Balls in a can.
        
    - Plates stacked in a cafeteria.
        
    - Bags or goods stacked in a shop.
        
    - Train shunting yard (reversing train direction).
        

**Key idea:** The last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

## 2. Applications of Stack

- **Daily life examples:**
    
    - Parking lanes with single exit.
        
    - Balls or plates stacked.
        
    - Train reversing using a shunting track.
        
- **Programming / CS:**
    
    - **Recursion:** Each recursive call uses system stack for execution.
        
    - **Converting recursion to iteration:** Sometimes requires an explicit programmer-defined stack.
        
    - **Backtracking problems** (mazes, expression parsing, undo operations).

## 3. Stack as an Abstract Data Type (ADT)

- **Representation:**
    
    - **Collection of elements** (stored in an array or linked list).
        
    - **Top pointer:** Always points to the most recently inserted element.
        
- **Basic Operations:**
    
    1. **Push(x):** Insert element `x` at the top.
        
    2. **Pop():** Remove the top element.
        
    3. **Peek(i):** Look at element at position `i` (counting from the top). Does not remove it.
        
    4. **StackTop():** Return the current top element.
        
    5. **isEmpty():** Check if stack has no elements.
        
    6. **isFull():** Check if stack is completely filled (in array implementation).

## 4. Working of Operations (Example)

- Suppose stack has values: `[10, 16, 20, 25]` (25 is top).
    
    - `Push(30)` â†’ stack becomes `[10, 16, 20, 25, 30]`, top points to 30.
        
    - `Pop()` â†’ removes 30, top becomes 25.
        
    - `Peek(2)` â†’ gives second element from top = 20.
        
    - `StackTop()` â†’ gives 25.
        
    - If all elements are removed â†’ stack is **empty**.
        
    - If maximum size is reached â†’ stack is **full**.

## 5. Implementation Approaches

- **Array-based Stack:**
    
    - Fixed size, simple to implement.
        
    - May cause overflow if size exceeded.
        
- **Linked List-based Stack:**
    
    - Dynamic size (no overflow unless memory full).
        
    - Slightly more complex to implement.
