# ðŸ“˜ Circular Linked List (CLL) â€“ Introduction

## ðŸ”¹ Definition

- A **linked list** where the **last node points back to the first node**, instead of `NULL`.
    
- Alternatively: _nodes are circularly connected_.
    
- No strict _first_ or _last_ node â†’ we usually refer to an entry pointer as **`head`**.
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- Traversal is **circular**:
    
    - Start from `head â†’ next â†’ next â€¦` eventually returns back to `head`.
        
- Useful when data must be accessed repeatedly in a cycle (e.g., music playlists, contact lists with wraparound scrolling).
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ Special Cases

1. **Single node CLL:**
    
    - Nodeâ€™s `next` points to itself.
        
2. **Empty list:**
    
    - If using **1st representation** â†’ `head = NULL`.
        
    - If using **2nd representation** (dummy head) â†’ `head` points to itself, even when no data nodes exist.

## ðŸ”¹ Two Representations

### 1. **Without Dummy Head (Commonly used)**

- Just like singly linked list but last node points to first.
    
- If empty â†’ `head = NULL`.
    
- Example (3 nodes):
    
    ```
    head â†’ 10 â†’ 20 â†’ 30 â†’ back to head
    ```
    

### 2. **With Dummy Head Node**

- An extra **head node** is maintained that:
    
    - Does **not store data**.
        
    - Points to first data node (or itself if list is empty).
        
- Ensures the list is _circular even when empty_.
    
- Example (3 nodes):
    
    ```
    head(dummy) â†’ 10 â†’ 20 â†’ 30 â†’ back to 10
    head(dummy) points to first data node
    ```

## ðŸ”¹ Benefits

- No strict beginning or end.
    
- Circular traversal is easy.
    
- Useful for applications where data cycles around.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Differences vs Linear Linked List

|Linear Linked List|Circular Linked List|
|---|---|
|Last node points to `NULL`|Last node points back to first|
|Has clear start and end|No strict start/end, use `head`|
|Traversal stops at NULL|Traversal can continue indefinitely|

âœ… So the main takeaway:

- **CLL is just a singly linked list with an extra circular connection**.
    
- Can be represented in **two ways**:
    
    - Simple (`head = NULL` when empty).
        
    - Dummy head node (`head` points to itself when empty).

Do you want me to also prepare **basic C code templates** for circular linked list operations (create, traverse, insert, delete) to complement these notes?
