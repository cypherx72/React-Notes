# **Linked List – Useful Statements & Conditions**

## 1. **Pointer Assignment**

- If `Q = P;`  
    → Both `Q` and `P` point to the **same node** (same address).
    
- If `Q = P->next;`  
    → `Q` now points to the **next node of P**.
    
- If `P = P->next;`  
    → `P` is moved forward to the **next node**.
    
    - Very commonly used in traversal.
        
    - Example:
        
        ```cpp
        while(P != NULL) {
            // process node
            P = P->next;   // move to next node
        }
        ```

## 2. **Null Pointer Representation**

- A pointer not pointing to any node = `NULL` (or `0`).
    
- Two cases:
    
    - If `P = NULL` → pointer is not pointing anywhere.
        
    - If `P != NULL` → pointer is pointing to some node.

## 3. **Checking if Pointer is Null**

Equivalent conditions for **"P is not pointing anywhere"**:

```cpp
if (P == NULL)     // method 1
if (P == 0)        // method 2
if (!P)            // method 3
```

Equivalent conditions for **"P is pointing to some node"**:

```cpp
if (P != NULL)     // method 1
if (P != 0)        // method 2
if (P)             // method 3
```

---

## 4. **Checking Last Node**

- To check whether a node is the **last node**:
    

```cpp
if (P->next == NULL) {
    // P is the last node
}
```

- To check if there exists another node after `P`:
    

```cpp
if (P->next != NULL) {
    // There is a next node
}
```

## 5. **Summary**

- **Q = P;** → Both pointers point to same node.
    
- **Q = P->next;** → Q points to next node of P.
    
- **P = P->next;** → Move P to next node (used in traversal).
    
- **Null check**: `(P == NULL)`, `(P == 0)`, or `(!P)`.
    
- **Valid node check**: `(P != NULL)`, `(P != 0)`, or `(P)`.
    
- **Last node check**: `(P->next == NULL)`.
    
- **Has next node check**: `(P->next != NULL)`.

👉 These small statements are the **building blocks** for traversal, insertion, and deletion in linked lists.

Do you want me to also prepare a **compact “cheat sheet” with pointer operations** (with diagrams of P, Q, and next links) so you can quickly revise these without re-reading full notes?
