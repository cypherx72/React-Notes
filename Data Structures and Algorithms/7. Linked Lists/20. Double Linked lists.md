# ðŸ“˜ Notes: Introduction to Doubly Linked List (DLL)

### 1. What is a Doubly Linked List?

- A **linked list** where each node contains:
    
    - Data
        
    - A pointer to the **previous** node
        
    - A pointer to the **next** node
        
- Unlike a singly linked list, traversal is **bi-directional**:
    
    - Forward (next â†’ next â†’ â€¦)
        
    - Backward (prev â†’ prev â†’ â€¦)

### 2. Examples in Real Life

- **Web Browser History**: move _backward_ to the previous page or _forward_ to the next page.
    
- **Contact List / Phonebook**: scroll up (previous) and down (next).

### 3. Node Structure in DLL

Each node contains **3 parts**:

1. Pointer to **previous node**
    
2. **Data field**
    
3. Pointer to **next node**
    

In C:

```c
struct Node {
    struct Node *prev;  // pointer to previous node
    int data;           // data value
    struct Node *next;  // pointer to next node
};
```

---

### 4. Creating a Node (Example)

```c
struct Node *t;
t = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));  // create new node

t->prev = NULL;  // initially no previous
t->data = 10;    // store value
t->next = NULL;  // initially no next
```

---

### 5. Operations on DLL

Similar to singly linked list but with **bi-directional traversal**:

- **Traversal/Display**: forward & backward
    
- **Count nodes**
    
- **Search for element**
    
- **Find max/min**
    
- **Insert node** (at head, at tail, before/after a node)
    
- **Delete node**
    

---

### 6. Advantages over Singly Linked List

- Can move **both directions**
    
- Easier deletion (no need to traverse entire list to find previous node)
    
- More flexible in certain use cases
    

---

ðŸ‘‰ In summary:  
DLL = Singly Linked List + extra pointer (`prev`).  
Extra memory is needed, but it gives more flexibility for traversal and deletion.

Do you want me to also expand this into a **C program with basic DLL operations** (create, display forward & backward, insert, delete), so you have both the **theory + code** in one place?
