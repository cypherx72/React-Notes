Perfect ðŸ‘Œ Youâ€™ve now reached the **sum of all elements in a linked list** â€” both iteratively and recursively. Letâ€™s put the two side by side, and highlight the differences clearly.

---

## **Iterative Method**

```c
int Add(struct Node *p) {
    int sum = 0;

    while (p != NULL) {          // traverse until end
        sum += p->data;          // accumulate node's data
        p = p->next;             // move to next node
    }

    return sum;                  // final sum
}
```

- Starts `sum = 0`.
    
- Adds each nodeâ€™s data while moving `p` forward.
    
- Loop terminates when `p == NULL`.
    
- **Time:** O(n), **Space:** O(1) (no recursion stack).

## **Recursive Method**

```c
int Add(struct Node *p) {
    if (p == NULL)               // base case
        return 0;
    else
        return Add(p->next) + p->data;
}
```

- Base case: empty list â‡’ `0`.
    
- Otherwise: recursively get sum of rest of list, then add current `p->data`.
    
- **Time:** O(n), **Space:** O(n) (recursion stack with n+1 calls).
    

---

## **Comparison**

- Both traverse each node exactly once â‡’ **O(n) time**.
    
- Iterative is memory-efficient (`O(1)` space).
    
- Recursive is elegant and compact, but stack grows with list size (`O(n)` space).
    

---

âœ… Notice the **parallel with the `Count` function** you wrote earlier:

- In `Count`, every call contributed `+1`.
    
- In `Add`, every call contributes `+ p->data`.
    

The recursion pattern is exactly the same â€” just what you add is different.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also trace the **recursive sum function step-by-step with a sample list** (like `[8, 3, 7, 12, 9]`) so you can see how the partial sums build up on return?
