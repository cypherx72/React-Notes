## ðŸ”¹ What is Concatenation?

- **Concatenation** means joining two linked lists together.
    
- Example:
    
    - List1: `2 â†’ 9 â†’ 6 â†’ 8 â†’ NULL`
        
    - List2: `10 â†’ 12 â†’ 14 â†’ NULL`
        
    - After concatenation:  
        `2 â†’ 9 â†’ 6 â†’ 8 â†’ 10 â†’ 12 â†’ 14 â†’ NULL`

## ðŸ”¹ Procedure

1. Take a pointer `P` and set it to the head of the **first list**.
    
2. Traverse the first list using `P` until `P->next == NULL` (last node).
    
3. When at last node, make:
    
    ```
    P->next = second
    ```
    
    (where `second` is the head pointer of the second list).
    
4. Optionally: set `second = NULL` if you donâ€™t want the second pointer anymore.

## ðŸ”¹ Pseudocode

```c
void concatenate(Node* first, Node* second) {
    if (first == NULL) {   // If first list is empty
        first = second;
        return;
    }
    
    Node* P = first;
    while (P->next != NULL) {
        P = P->next;       // Traverse to last node
    }
    
    P->next = second;      // Join second list
    // second = NULL;  // optional: detach second pointer
}
```

## ðŸ”¹ Example Trace

- First list: `1 â†’ 3 â†’ 5 â†’ NULL`
    
- Second list: `7 â†’ 9 â†’ 11 â†’ NULL`
    

Steps:

- Traverse first list until last node (`5`).
    
- Change `5->next = 7`.
    
- Result: `1 â†’ 3 â†’ 5 â†’ 7 â†’ 9 â†’ 11 â†’ NULL`.

## ðŸ”¹ Analysis

- **Extra pointer required:** just one (`P`).
    
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the first list (because you must traverse it).
    
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.

âœ… **Summary:**  
Concatenation simply means traversing the first list to its last node and linking it to the head of the second list. Simple, efficient, and widely used.
