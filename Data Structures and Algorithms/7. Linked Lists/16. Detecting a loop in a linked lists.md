# ðŸ“˜ Detecting a Loop in a Linked List

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Loop?

- A **linear linked list** ends with `NULL`.
    
- A **circular/looped linked list** has the last node pointing back to some earlier node in the list (not `NULL`).

## ðŸ”¹ NaÃ¯ve Approaches

1. **Traverse and store addresses**
    
    - Keep visited node addresses in a hash table or array.
        
    - If the same address appears again â†’ loop exists.
        
    - Requires extra space (**O(n)**).
        
2. **Check for repeated data (if unique)**
    
    - If data is unique, store visited values.
        
    - Repeated value â†’ loop.
        
    - But not reliable (data may not be unique).

## ðŸ”¹ Efficient Approach: Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection

- Use **two pointers**:
    
    - `slow` (moves 1 step at a time).
        
    - `fast` (moves 2 steps at a time).
        

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize:
    
    ```c
    slow = head;
    fast = head;
    ```
    
2. Loop:
    
    - Move `slow = slow->next`.
        
    - Move `fast = fast->next->next`.
        
    - If `slow == fast` â†’ **loop detected**.
        
    - If `fast == NULL` or `fast->next == NULL` â†’ **no loop (linear)**.

## ðŸ”¹ C Code Example

```c
int isLoop(struct Node *head) {
    struct Node *slow = head, *fast = head;

    while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
        slow = slow->next;           // move 1 step
        fast = fast->next->next;     // move 2 steps

        if (slow == fast) {          // they meet again
            return 1; // loop exists
        }
    }
    return 0; // linear list
}
```

## ðŸ”¹ Analysis

- **Pointers needed:** 2
    
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (constant space)
    

---

âœ… So the key idea:

- **Linear list:** one pointer eventually becomes `NULL`.
    
- **Looped list:** fast and slow pointers will eventually meet.

Would you like me to also add the **step to find the starting node of the loop** (after detecting it), or just keep it limited to detection?
