### ðŸ”¹ Concept

- **Merging** = combining two sorted lists into a single sorted list.
    
- Example:
    
    - List 1: `2 â†’ 8 â†’ 10 â†’ 15`
        
    - List 2: `4 â†’ 7 â†’ 12 â†’ 14`
        
    - Merged: `2 â†’ 4 â†’ 7 â†’ 8 â†’ 10 â†’ 12 â†’ 14 â†’ 15`

### ðŸ”¹ Difference from Arrays

- **Arrays**: require a third array to store merged result.
    
- **Linked Lists**: do **not** require an extra list; nodes can be linked directly.
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ Pointers Used

1. **third** â†’ points to the head (first node) of the merged list.
    
2. **last** â†’ points to the last node of the merged list (to attach new nodes).
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ Procedure

1. **Initialize**: Compare first node of both lists.
    
    - Whichever is smaller becomes the first node of merged list.
        
    - Set both `third` and `last` to this node.
        
    - Advance that listâ€™s pointer (first/second).
        
    - Set `last->next = NULL`.
        
2. **Repeat**:
    
    - Compare current nodes of both lists.
        
    - Attach the smaller node to `last->next`.
        
    - Move `last` to that node.
        
    - Advance that listâ€™s pointer.
        
    - Set `last->next = NULL`.
        
3. **Termination**:
    
    - Stop when either list becomes empty (`NULL`).
        
4. **Attach Remaining Nodes**:
    
    - If list1 not empty â†’ `last->next = first`.
        
    - Else if list2 not empty â†’ `last->next = second`.
        

---

### ðŸ”¹ Loop Condition

```
while (first != NULL && second != NULL) {
    // compare and attach smaller node
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity

- Each element is visited once.
    
- If list1 has `M` elements and list2 has `N`:
    
    - **Time = O(M + N)**
        
- **Space = O(1)** (no extra linked list needed).
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ Advantages

- **Efficient**: Works in linear time.
    
- **Memory-friendly**: No need for extra list unlike arrays.
    
- **Directly reusable** in Merge Sort for linked lists.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:  
Merging two sorted linked lists uses two pointers (`third`, `last`) to build a new sorted list in-place, runs in **O(M+N)**, and does not require extra memory.
