Got it 👍 You’re talking about writing a **recursive function to count nodes in a linked list**, and showing that we can slightly restructure the function (with or without introducing a local variable) but the logic remains the same.

Let me rewrite and explain the three styles you’ve just described.

---

## **1. Direct Recursive Count**

This is the most compact way:

```c
int Count(struct Node *p) {
    if (p != NULL)
        return 1 + Count(p->next);   // add 1 for this node
    else
        return 0;                    // base case: null means 0
}
```

✔️ Very direct. Each non-null node contributes **1** plus the count of the rest.

---

## **2. Flipped Condition (equivalent but reordered)**

Here you check in the opposite way:

```c
int Count(struct Node *p) {
    if (p == NULL)
        return 0;                    // base case first
    else
        return 1 + Count(p->next);   // otherwise, count + rest
}
```

✔️ Same logic, just **base case first**.  
Both styles are identical in time and space.

---

## **3. Using a Local Variable**

Here we store the recursive result in a variable:

```c
int Count(struct Node *p) {
    int x = 0;                       // local variable initialized to 0
    if (p) {                         // shorthand for (p != NULL)
        x = Count(p->next);          // recursive call
        return x + 1;                // add 1 for current node
    } else {
        return x;                    // x is still 0 here
    }
}
```

✔️ Equivalent to the first two.  
✔️ `if (p)` is a neat C idiom → true if `p` is non-null.

## **Key Takeaways**

- All three versions compute the **length of the linked list**.
    
- **Time complexity:** `O(n)` (traverses each node once).
    
- **Space complexity:** `O(n)` (recursion stack).
    
- Using a **local variable** doesn’t change complexity; it’s just a different style, sometimes useful for clarity or debugging.

👉 Do you want me to also show you how this function would **trace step-by-step with stack frames** for a sample list (like you did with the display function), so you can see how `x` evolves in version 3?
