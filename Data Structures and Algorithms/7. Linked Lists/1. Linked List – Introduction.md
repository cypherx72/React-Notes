## 1. **Why do we need Linked List?**

- Arrays have **fixed size** (decided at compile time).
    
- At runtime, the number of elements to be stored is often **unknown**.
    
- Problems with arrays:
    
    - **Insufficient size**: If declared small (e.g., 10), cannot store more than 10 elements.
        
    - **Excess size**: If declared large (e.g., 100) but only 2â€“3 elements are stored, memory is wasted.
        
- In real programs, **users** decide how many elements to input, so size cannot always be predetermined.

## 2. **Arrays â€“ Recap**

- **Creation**:
    
    - In **stack**: `int a[5];` â†’ fixed size inside activation record.
        
    - In **heap**: `int* p = new int[5];` â†’ size can be given at runtime, but still fixed once allocated.
        
- **Memory Layout**:
    
    - Contiguous (side-by-side).
        
    - Allows **random access** using index (`a[0], a[1], ...`).
        
- **Analogy**: Like a fixed-length **bench**:
    
    - Capacity is decided at creation.
        
    - If more people arrive â†’ no space.
        
    - If fewer people arrive â†’ space wasted.

## 3. **Linked List â€“ Basic Idea**

- Designed to overcome **fixed size** limitation of arrays.
    
- Properties:
    
    - **Variable size**: Can grow or shrink at runtime.
        
    - Memory allocated dynamically in **heap**.
        
    - Supports **easy insertion and deletion**.

## 4. **How Linked List Works**

- Use a **pointer (first)** to keep track of the starting node.
    
- Each element is stored in a separate **node**:
    
    - A **node** = (data + pointer to next node).
        
    - Last nodeâ€™s pointer = `NULL`.
        
- Example:
    
    - Node 1 â†’ stores `8` and pointer to Node 2.
        
    - Node 2 â†’ stores `3` and pointer to Node 3.
        
    - Node 3 â†’ stores `12` and pointer `NULL`.

## 5. **Advantages of Linked List over Array**

- **Dynamic sizing**: No pre-decided size; memory allocated as needed.
    
- **Efficient insertion/deletion**:
    
    - Insert element between nodes by changing pointers.
        
    - Remove element by linking previous node directly to next node.
        
- **Analogy**: Like a row of **chairs**:
    
    - Each new person brings their own chair.
        
    - People can leave and take their chair away.
        
    - Chairs are linked together in sequence.

## 6. **Key Takeaways**

- **Array**:
    
    - Fixed size.
        
    - Contiguous memory.
        
    - Random access supported.
        
- **Linked List**:
    
    - Variable size.
        
    - Nodes allocated in heap.
        
    - Sequential access only (must follow links).
        
    - Supports flexible insertion/deletion.

ðŸ‘‰ This lecture was only an **idea/introduction** of linked lists.  
The next step would be to study **detailed implementation** (structure of node, pointer manipulation, traversal, insertion, deletion, etc.).

Do you want me to also prepare a **side-by-side comparison table** (Array vs Linked List) for quick revision?
