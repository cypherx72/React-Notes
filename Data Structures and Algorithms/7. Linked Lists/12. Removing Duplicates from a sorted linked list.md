# ðŸ“’ Notes: Removing Duplicates from a Sorted Linked List

### **Problem**

Given a **sorted linked list**, remove duplicate nodes so that only distinct elements remain.

Example:  
Input: `3 â†’ 5 â†’ 5 â†’ 8 â†’ 8 â†’ 8`  
Output: `3 â†’ 5 â†’ 8`

---

## **Procedure**

1. **Use two pointers:**
    
    - `P` â†’ points to the current node.
        
    - `Q` â†’ points to the next node (`P->next`).
        
2. **Compare data of P and Q**:
    
    - If `P->data != Q->data`:
        
        - Slide both pointers forward:
            
            - `P = Q`
                
            - `Q = Q->next`
                
    - If `P->data == Q->data`:
        
        - Remove the duplicate (`Q`):
            
            1. `P->next = Q->next` (skip Q).
                
            2. `delete Q`.
                
            3. Move `Q = P->next`.
                
3. **Repeat until Q becomes NULL** (end of list).

## **Pseudocode**

```cpp
void removeDuplicates(Node* first) {
    Node *P = first;
    Node *Q = first->next;

    while (Q != NULL) {
        if (P->data != Q->data) {
            P = Q;
            Q = Q->next;
        } else {
            P->next = Q->next;  // unlink duplicate
            delete Q;           // free memory
            Q = P->next;        // move Q forward
        }
    }
}
```

## **Example Trace**

List: `3 â†’ 5 â†’ 5 â†’ 8 â†’ 8 â†’ 8`

- Compare `3, 5` â†’ not equal â†’ slide pointers.
    
- Compare `5, 5` â†’ equal â†’ delete second `5`.
    
- Compare `5, 8` â†’ not equal â†’ slide.
    
- Compare `8, 8` â†’ equal â†’ delete one `8`.
    
- Compare `8, 8` â†’ equal â†’ delete one more `8`.
    
- End result: `3 â†’ 5 â†’ 8`.
    

---

## **Analysis**

- **Extra pointers**: 2 (`P` and `Q`).
    
- **Time complexity**: `O(n)` (full traversal required).
    
- **Space complexity**: `O(1)` (in-place modification).
    

---

## âœ… Key Points

- Works only because the list is **sorted** (duplicates appear consecutively).
    
- Always delete the **second node (Q)** when a duplicate is found.
    
- Stop when `Q == NULL`.
    
- Must free the memory (`delete Q`) to avoid memory leaks.

Would you like me to also write **notes + pseudocode for the unsorted linked list duplicate removal** (which needs hashing or nested loops)? That way your notes will cover both sorted and unsorted cases.
