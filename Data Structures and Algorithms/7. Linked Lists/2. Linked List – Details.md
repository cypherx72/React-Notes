## 1. **Definition**

- **Linked List**: A collection of nodes, where **each node contains**:
    
    - **Data** (value to store).
        
    - **Pointer** to the next node.
        
- Continuity is maintained through **links (addresses)**, not by contiguous memory (unlike arrays).
    
- Always created in **heap memory**.
    
- **Head (or First)**: A pointer pointing to the first node.
    

---

## 2. **Addresses in Linked List**

- In arrays â†’ addresses are **contiguous** (`200, 202, 204â€¦`).
    
- In linked list â†’ addresses are **scattered** (e.g., `200, 210, 270, 300â€¦`).
    
- Continuity is maintained via **pointers (links)**.

## 3. **Node Structure**

- A **Node** contains:
    
    1. Data (any type: int, float, double, etc.).
        
    2. Pointer to next node (of same type).
        

### In C (structure definition):

```c
struct node {
    int data;              // data field
    struct node* next;     // pointer to next node
};
```

- Node has a pointer of **its own type** â†’ called a **Self-Referential Structure**.
    
- Self-referential structures are the basis of linked lists.
    

### In C++:

- Can use either **struct** or **class**:
    
    - In **struct** â†’ members are public by default.
        
    - In **class** â†’ members are private by default.

## 4. **Size of a Node**

- Depends on size of **data type** and **pointer**.
    
- Example (assuming `int = 2 bytes`, pointer = `2 bytes`):
    
    - Data = 2 bytes.
        
    - Pointer = 2 bytes.
        
    - Total = **4 bytes per node**.
        
- Example memory layout:
    
    - Node starting at address 200 â†’ occupies `200â€“203`.
        
    - Node starting at address 210 â†’ occupies `210â€“213`.
        

---

## 5. **Creating a Node**

### In C:

```c
struct node* P;
P = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
```

- `malloc` allocates memory in heap.
    
- Returns a `void*`, so typecasting is required.
    

### In C++ (simpler):

```cpp
node* P;
P = new node;
```

- `new` automatically allocates memory in heap.
    

---

## 6. **Accessing Node Members**

- Use **arrow operator (`->`)** when pointer is used.
    

Example:

```cpp
P->data = 10;    // store 10 in data
P->next = NULL;  // pointer to next node = NULL
```

- `P->data` â†’ accesses data field.
    
- `P->next` â†’ accesses pointer to next node.
    

---

## 7. **Summary**

- **Linked list** = dynamic collection of nodes.
    
- **Node** = (data + pointer to next).
    
- **Head** = starting pointer of list.
    
- Defined using **self-referential structures**.
    
- Node size = data size + pointer size.
    
- Node creation:
    
    - In **C**: use `malloc`.
        
    - In **C++**: use `new`.
        
- Members are accessed via `->` operator.

ðŸ‘‰ This lecture sets the foundation for **node-level operations**.  
The next logical step will be learning **linking multiple nodes** to actually form a linked list (insertion, traversal, deletion, etc.).

Would you like me to also make a **diagram-style cheat sheet** (Node structure + memory + pointer arrows) so you have a visual reference for revision?
