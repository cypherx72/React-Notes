### 1. Basic Concept

- In a linked list, inserting a node at the end usually requires traversing the entire list from the `first` node to the last node → **O(n)** time.
    
- To make it efficient, we can maintain a pointer called **`last`** that always points to the last node.
    
- This way, insertion at the end becomes **O(1)** time.

### 2. Cases to Handle

1. **Empty List (No nodes initially)**
    
    - Both `first` and `last` should be `NULL`.
        
    - When inserting the first node:
        
        - Make `first` and `last` point to the new node.
            
2. **List Already Exists**
    
    - Create a new node `t` with the given value.
        
    - Make `last->next` point to `t`.
        
    - Update `last = t`.

### 3. Steps for `insertLast(x)` Function

1. Create a new node `t`.
    
    - `t->data = x`
        
    - `t->next = NULL`
        
2. If list is empty (`first == NULL`):
    
    - `first = last = t`
        
3. Otherwise:
    
    - `last->next = t`
        
    - `last = t`

### 4. Example Walkthrough

- Insert `8`:
    
    - New node `8` created.
        
    - Both `first` and `last` point to this node.
        
- Insert `3`:
    
    - New node `3` created.
        
    - `last->next = 3`
        
    - Move `last` to node `3`.
        
- Insert `9`:
    
    - New node `9` created.
        
    - `last->next = 9`
        
    - Move `last` to node `9`.
        

Final list:  
`8 -> 3 -> 9 -> NULL`  
`first` points to 8, `last` points to 9.

### 5. Advantages

- **Constant time insertion** at the end (no traversal needed).
    
- Clean and simple function that always inserts a node.
    
- Works even if the list is initially empty.

### 6. Pseudocode

```c
void insertLast(int x) {
    Node* t = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));
    t->data = x;
    t->next = NULL;

    if (first == NULL) {
        first = last = t;  // first node case
    } else {
        last->next = t;    // attach at the end
        last = t;          // move last
    }
}
```

✅ With this approach, you can keep calling `insertLast(x)` repeatedly to build the list efficiently.

Do you want me to also write a **full C program** with `insertLast()` + `display()` so you can test and see the linked list grow?
