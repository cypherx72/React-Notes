## 📘 **Introduction to Structures in C**

### 🧠 What is a Structure?

- A **structure** is a user-defined data type in C that groups **related data members** under one name.
    
- These data members can be of **similar or dissimilar types**.
    
- Used when a single entity is defined by **multiple values** (e.g., a rectangle defined by both _length_ and _breadth_).
    

---

### 🏗️ Structure Syntax & Example

```c
struct Rectangle {
    int length;
    int breadth;
};
```

- The `Rectangle` structure groups two integers under one entity.
    
- You can change types (e.g., float) based on your needs.
    

---

### 💾 Memory Consideration

- If `int` = 2 bytes → structure occupies 4 bytes.
    
- But defining a structure does **not** allocate memory.
    
- Memory is allocated when a **structure variable** is declared.
    

---

### 📦 Declaring and Initializing Structure Variables

```c
struct Rectangle r;              // Declaration only
struct Rectangle r = {10, 5};    // Declaration + Initialization
```

- Memory for `r` is created in the **stack frame** of the `main` function.
    

---

### 🧮 Accessing Structure Members

- Use the **dot (.) operator**:
    

```c
r.length = 15;
r.breadth = 10;
```

---

### 📐 Calculating Area of Rectangle

```c
printf("Area of rectangle: %d", r.length * r.breadth);
// Output → 150 (for 15 * 10)
```

## 🔁 More Structure Examples

### 📌 1. Complex Numbers

- Complex number = A + iB → requires two parts: real and imaginary.
    

```c
struct Complex {
    float real;
    float imag;
};
```

---

### 📌 2. Student Data

- Fields: roll number, name, department, address
    

```c
struct Student {
    int rollNo;             // 2 bytes
    char name[25];          // 25 bytes
    char dept[10];          // 10 bytes
    char address[50];       // 50 bytes
};                          // Total = ~87 bytes
```

**Accessing members:**

```c
struct Student s;
s.rollNo = 10;
strcpy(s.name, "John");  // Use `strcpy` for strings
```

### 📌 3. Playing Cards

- A playing card has:
    
    - Face Value (1–13): 1 = Ace, 11 = Jack, 12 = Queen, 13 = King
        
    - Shape (encoded as int):
        
        - 0 = Club ♣
            
        - 1 = Spade ♠
            
        - 2 = Diamond ♦
            
        - 3 = Heart ♥
            
    - Color: Red / Black (optional as a string or boolean)
        

```c
struct Card {
    int faceValue;
    int shape;     // 0 to 3
    char color[6]; // "red" or "black"
};
```

## 🧠 Recap: Structure Essentials

|Concept|Syntax / Detail|
|---|---|
|Structure Definition|`struct TagName { members };`|
|Declaration|`struct TagName var;`|
|Initialization|`struct TagName var = {value1, value2};`|
|Member Access|`var.member`|
|Memory Allocation|Done when a variable is declared|
|Storage Location|In stack if declared inside a function|

## 🚀 Takeaways

- Structures allow bundling multiple types into a single unit.
    
- They are the foundation for more advanced concepts like:
    
    - Arrays of structures
        
    - Pointers to structures
        
    - Structures in functions
        
    - Nested structures
