Excellent ðŸ‘Œ â€” youâ€™ve basically written out a **lecture script** on how recursion uses stack memory. Let me tighten it up, organize the flow, and highlight the **key teaching points** so your audience can clearly follow it without losing detail.

# ðŸ“Œ How Recursion Uses Stack

Weâ€™ve already seen that recursive functions have **two phases**:

- **Ascending phase** â†’ going deeper (function calls itself).
    
- **Descending phase** â†’ coming back (functions return one by one).
    

Now letâ€™s connect this with **stack memory**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Memory Model

In C (and similar languages), memory is divided into three main sections:

1. **Code section** â†’ program instructions (machine code of functions).
    
2. **Heap** â†’ dynamically allocated memory.
    
3. **Stack** â†’ activation records (function call frames).
    

Whenever a function is called, an **activation record** (stack frame) is created in the stack.  
This frame stores:

- The functionâ€™s local variables
    
- Return address (where to continue after the call finishes)
    

When the function ends, its activation record is **popped** (deleted) from the stack.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example 1 (fun1)

```c
void fun1(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        printf("%d ", n);
        fun1(n - 1);
    }
}
```

### Execution (n = 3)

1. `main` creates variable `x = 3`.  
    â†’ Activation record for `main` goes on stack.
    
2. `fun1(3)` is called.  
    â†’ Activation record for `fun1` with `n=3` is created.
    
3. Inside `fun1(3)`, `printf(3)` executes.  
    Then `fun1(2)` is called â†’ another activation record (with `n=2`).
    
4. This repeats until `fun1(0)` is called.  
    At `n=0`, condition fails â†’ no more recursive calls.
    
5. Now stack **unwinds**: activation records are deleted one by one as each call returns.

### Stack Growth (n=3)

```
Top â†’ fun1(0)
       fun1(1)
       fun1(2)
       fun1(3)
Bottom â†’ main(x=3)
```

- Maximum depth = **n+1 activation records** (including base case).
    
- For n=3 â†’ 4 records created.
    

ðŸ“Œ **Space Complexity = O(n)** (since stack grows linearly with n).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example 2 (fun2)

```c
void fun2(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        fun2(n - 1);
        printf("%d ", n);
    }
}
```

Here the difference is:

- In **fun1**, printing happens during **ascending** (going down).
    
- In **fun2**, printing happens during **descending** (coming back).
    

But in **both cases**:

- The number of activation records created is the same â†’ **n+1**.
    
- Stack is used in the same way.
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Observations

- Each recursive call = new activation record pushed onto the stack.
    
- When base case is reached, stack starts **unwinding** (records popped).
    
- Stack size = **n+1 records** â†’ **Space Complexity = O(n)**.
    
- Recursive functions consume more memory than loops, because loops donâ€™t need multiple activation records.
    

---

âœ… So the takeaway: **recursion always uses stack**, and stack memory grows with the number of calls. Thatâ€™s why recursion is elegant but can be memory-expensive.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Next step (as you said): weâ€™ll study **time complexity** of recursive functions, starting with this same example, then moving to more complex ones (like factorial and Fibonacci).

Would you like me to first build a **recurrence relation explanation** for fun1/fun2 (`T(n) = T(n-1) + c`) and then generalize to **factorial/Fibonacci**?
