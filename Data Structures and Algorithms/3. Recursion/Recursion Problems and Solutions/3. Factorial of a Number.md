Got it 👍  
This passage is essentially a **teaching explanation** of the factorial problem using **recursion and iteration**. Let me break it down into crisp learning points for you:

---

### 🔹 What is Factorial?

- Factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`) = `1 × 2 × 3 × … × n`
    
- Example: `5! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120`
    
- Special cases:
    
    - `0! = 1`
        
    - `1! = 1`
        

---

### 🔹 Recursive Definition

From math:

```
n! = n × (n-1)!
```

Base case:

```
0! = 1
```

---

### 🔹 Recursive Function (C/C++ style)

```c
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0)  // base case
        return 1;
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1);  // recursive call
}
```

---

### 🔹 Iterative Function (loop version)

```c
int factorial(int n) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}
```

---

### 🔹 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` (both recursive and iterative)
    
- **Space Complexity:**
    
    - Iterative → `O(1)` (just a variable to hold result)
        
    - Recursive → `O(n)` (stack frames for recursive calls)
        

---

✅ **Key takeaway:**

- Recursion directly models the mathematical definition.
    
- Iteration is usually more memory-efficient.
    
- Both run in linear time.

Would you like me to also **compare recursion vs iteration for factorial** in a **table format** (pros/cons, efficiency, readability)? That will give you a clear side-by-side view.
