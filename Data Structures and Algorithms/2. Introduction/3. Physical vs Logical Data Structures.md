### 🔑 Key Points from the Lecture

1. **Background Recap**
    
    - Memory in a program is divided into sections like **stack** and **heap**.
        
    - **Static memory allocation** (fixed at compile-time) vs **dynamic memory allocation** (decided at runtime).
        
2. **Types of Data Structures**
    
    - **Physical Data Structures** → Define _how memory is organized_.
        
    - **Logical Data Structures** → Define _how data is used and accessed_.

### 🏗️ Physical Data Structures

1. **Array**
    
    - Directly supported in languages like C, C++, Java.
        
    - Collection of **contiguous memory locations**.
        
    - **Fixed size (static)** → cannot grow/shrink once created.
        
    - Can be created in **stack** or **heap**.
        
    - Suitable when the **maximum size of data is known** in advance.
        
2. **Linked List**
    
    - **Dynamic data structure** → collection of nodes (data + pointer to next node).
        
    - Can **grow/shrink** at runtime.
        
    - Always created in **heap** (but head pointer may sit in stack).
        
    - Suitable when the **size of data is unknown or variable**.
        

👉 **Reason they’re called physical:** because they define how memory is structured for storing elements.

### 📐 Logical Data Structures

- These specify the **discipline of accessing and modifying data**, not the physical storage.
    
- Examples:
    
    - **Stack** → LIFO (Last In, First Out).
        
    - **Queue** → FIFO (First In, First Out).
        
    - **Tree** → Hierarchical, non-linear.
        
    - **Graph** → Collection of nodes and links (relationships).
        
    - **Hash Table** → Tabular structure for fast key-value access.
        
- **Key Difference:**
    
    - Physical → actually hold the data in memory.
        
    - Logical → define rules/operations (insert, delete, search) on that data.
        
- **Implementation:** Logical data structures are built using **arrays**, **linked lists**, or combinations of both.

### 📚 Course Roadmap (as per lecture)

1. First study **Arrays** and **Linked Lists** in detail.
    
2. Then move to **logical structures** (stack, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables).
    
3. Implement each logical structure **using arrays and linked lists**.
    
4. Later cover subtypes (e.g., types of queues, trees, graphs).

✅ **Conclusion:**

- **Physical DS (Arrays, Linked Lists):** Memory organization.
    
- **Logical DS (Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, Hash Table):** Data usage discipline.
    
- Logical structures are **implemented using physical ones**.

Do you want me to also **turn this into a diagram/visual map** (like a chart showing Physical vs Logical, and how Logical uses Physical)? That’ll make the relationships much clearer.
