### 1. **Understanding Main Memory**

- **Memory** is divided into **bytes**, each with a **unique linear address** (0,1,2,3‚Ä¶ not (x,y) coordinates).
    
- Example: If addresses go from `0` to `65535` ‚Üí total `65536 bytes = 64 KB`.
    
- For this discussion, assume **1 segment = 64 KB memory**. (Real systems: GBs of RAM, but conceptually divided into **segments** of 64 KB.)

### 2. **Program‚Äôs Use of Memory**

- When a program runs, main memory is divided into **three main sections**:
    
    1. **Code Section** ‚Äì holds the **machine code** (instructions of program).
        
    2. **Stack** ‚Äì used for local variables and function calls.
        
    3. **Heap** ‚Äì used for dynamically allocated memory (discussed later).
        
- **Flow:**
    
    - Program (machine code) loaded from disk ‚Üí **code section**.
        
    - CPU executes code, while program uses **stack** & **heap** for variables/data.

### 3. **Stack Memory Usage**

- Example:
    
    ```c
    int a;   // integer (2 bytes assumed here)
    float b; // float (4 bytes assumed here)
    ```
    
    - Total memory needed = **6 bytes**.
        
    - These 6 bytes allocated in the **stack**.
        
- Memory allocated to a function = **stack frame** (aka **activation record**).
    
- Each function gets its own **activation record** on the stack.
    

---

### 4. **Static Memory Allocation**

- **Definition:** Memory for variables is **decided at compile time** by the compiler.
    
- Example:
    
    - Compiler sees `int a` (needs 2 bytes), `float b` (needs 4 bytes).
        
    - Total = 6 bytes ‚Üí compiler already knows before program runs.
        
    - At runtime, when program starts, **exact memory is reserved in stack**.
        
- **Key Points:**
    
    - **Static = size fixed at compile time.**
        
    - Stack memory is **automatically allocated** and **freed** when functions start/end.
        
    - Examples: local variables inside functions (`int`, `float`, `char[]` with fixed size).
        

---

### 5. **Characteristics of Static Memory Allocation**

- Memory requirements **pre-decided** ‚Üí cannot grow/shrink at runtime.
    
- **Fast** (stack allocation is quick).
    
- **Limited** (stack size is smaller compared to heap).
    
- Mostly used for:
    
    - Local variables
        
    - Fixed-size arrays

üëâ Up to here, we‚Äôve fully covered **Static Allocation**.  
The **next part** will contrast this with **Dynamic Memory Allocation (heap)** ‚Äî where memory size is decided at **runtime**.

Perfect ‚Äî this part of your script goes deeper into **function call sequences**, **stack frames**, and **dynamic memory allocation from the heap**. If you‚Äôre aiming for a smooth educational flow in your video, here‚Äôs how you can structure and polish this segment:

---

### 1. **Transition into Function Call Sequences**

Right after explaining static allocation, you could say something like:

> ‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs take it a step further. What happens when our program has multiple function calls? How does memory get allocated in the stack in such cases?‚Äù

This sets the context before diving into your example code.

---

### 2. **Function Call Example (Stack Behavior)**

- Keep your explanation of the **activation record** (stack frame) for each function call ‚Äî that‚Äôs clear and essential.
    
- Use a **visual diagram** (stack growing downwards, with `main ‚Üí fun1 ‚Üí fun2`) to reinforce the ‚ÄúLast In, First Out‚Äù (LIFO) behavior.
    
- Key points to highlight:
    
    - Each function call creates a new **activation record**.
        
    - The **topmost record** always belongs to the currently executing function.
        
    - Once a function ends, its record is popped from the stack.
        

‚ö°Tip: Add a ‚Äúpop‚Äù animation (block disappearing) when returning from functions to make the concept stick.

---

### 3. **Transition to Heap Memory**

After explaining stack frames, you can smoothly pivot by saying:

> ‚ÄúSo far, we‚Äôve seen how stack memory works automatically ‚Äî memory is allocated and freed without us doing anything. But what if we need more flexibility? That‚Äôs where the heap comes in.‚Äù

---

### 4. **Heap Memory Explanation**

- Emphasize the **contrast with stack**:
    
    - Stack is structured and automatic.
        
    - Heap is unstructured and manual.
        
- Mention heap as a **resource**:
    
    - You must **request memory** (`new` in C++ or `malloc` in C).
        
    - You must **release memory** (`delete` in C++ or `free` in C).
        
- Show the example of creating an array in the heap with a pointer.
    
- Highlight **memory leaks** with a quick scenario:
    
    - If memory is allocated but not released, it stays occupied and becomes unusable.
        
    - Over time, this leads to **memory exhaustion**.
        

‚ö°Tip: Here, a **visual contrasting stack vs heap** would help:

- Stack = neat stack of blocks (auto-managed).
    
- Heap = scattered blocks connected via pointers.
