Perfect 👍 You’ve broken it down really well. Let me now **summarize and extend** what you’ve explained, so it becomes a crisp **reference for both row-major and column-major mapping of 2D arrays**.

# 🔹 How Compilers Handle 2D Arrays

When you declare:

```c
int A[3][4];   // 3 rows × 4 columns
```

On paper, you visualize a 3×4 table (matrix).  
But in memory, it’s stored **linearly (1D block)**.

So the compiler needs a **mapping formula** to translate indices `(i, j)` into a **linear address**.

---

## 1️⃣ Row-Major Mapping (C/C++)

👉 Stored **row by row**.

For array: `A[M][N]` (M rows, N columns)

- Base address = `L0`
    
- Word size = `W` (bytes per element)
    

### Formula:

LOC(A[i][j])=L0+(i⋅N+j)⋅WLOC(A[i][j]) = L_0 + \big( i \cdot N + j \big) \cdot W

✅ Steps:

- Skip `i` rows → `i * N` elements
    
- Move `j` steps in current row
    
- Multiply by `W`
    

---

### Example

Array `A[3][4]` (3×4), base = 200, word size = 2

Find `A[1][2]`:

LOC=200+(1⋅4+2)⋅2=200+6⋅2=212LOC = 200 + \big(1 \cdot 4 + 2\big) \cdot 2 = 200 + 6 \cdot 2 = 212

Correct ✅

---

## 2️⃣ Column-Major Mapping (Fortran, MATLAB)

👉 Stored **column by column**.

For array: `A[M][N]`

- Base address = `L0`
    
- Word size = `W`
    

### Formula:

LOC(A[i][j])=L0+(j⋅M+i)⋅WLOC(A[i][j]) = L_0 + \big( j \cdot M + i \big) \cdot W

✅ Steps:

- Skip `j` columns → `j * M` elements
    
- Move `i` steps down in that column
    
- Multiply by `W`
    

---

### Example

Same array `A[3][4]` (3×4), base = 200, word size = 2

Find `A[1][2]`:

LOC=200+(2⋅3+1)⋅2=200+7⋅2=214LOC = 200 + \big( 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \big) \cdot 2 = 200 + 7 \cdot 2 = 214

Different address than row-major ✅

---

## 3️⃣ Indexing From 1 vs 0

- **C/C++** → indices always start at 0 → simpler formula.
    
- **Languages starting from 1** (like Fortran, Pascal):
    

LOC(A[i][j]) = L_0 + \big( (i-1) \cdot N + (j-1) \big) \cdot W  
] (row-major)

This requires extra `-1` operations → slightly slower.

---

## 🔑 Key Difference

- **Row-major** → left-to-right order → formula depends on **columns (N)**.
    
- **Column-major** → top-to-bottom order → formula depends on **rows (M)**.
    

---

Would you like me to now **draw both layouts (row-major vs column-major) for A[3][4]** side by side, so it’s crystal clear how the addresses are mapped in memory?

Perfect — you’ve explained **row-major mapping** and the reasoning behind its formula. Now let’s continue with **column-major mapping**, because that’s the second way compilers can map a 2-D array onto linear memory.

---

### 🔹 Column-Major Mapping

In **row-major**, we stored **row by row**.  
In **column-major**, we store **column by column**.

So if our array is 3×4 (`3 rows × 4 columns`):

```
A[0][0]  A[0][1]  A[0][2]  A[0][3]
A[1][0]  A[1][1]  A[1][2]  A[1][3]
A[2][0]  A[2][1]  A[2][2]  A[2][3]
```

In **column-major representation**, memory looks like this:

```
A[0][0], A[1][0], A[2][0],   // first column
A[0][1], A[1][1], A[2][1],   // second column
A[0][2], A[1][2], A[2][2],   // third column
A[0][3], A[1][3], A[2][3]    // fourth column
```

So we are going **down a column first**, before moving to the next column.

---

### 🔹 Formula for Column-Major Mapping

Let the 2-D array be `A[M][N]` → `M` rows, `N` columns.  
Each element takes `W` bytes.  
Base address = `L0`.

We want the address of element `A[i][j]`.

👉 In **column-major**, to reach `A[i][j]`:

1. Skip all previous columns (`j` columns). Each column has `M` elements.  
    → `j * M` elements skipped.
    
2. Then move down within the column by `i` elements.  
    → additional `i` elements skipped.
    
3. Multiply by word size (`W`).
    
4. Add base address (`L0`).
    

So:

Address(A[i][j])=L0+(j⋅M+i)⋅W\text{Address}(A[i][j]) = L0 + (j \cdot M + i) \cdot W

---

### 🔹 Example

Suppose:

- `A[3][4]` (3 rows × 4 columns)
    
- Base address `L0 = 200`
    
- Each element = 2 bytes
    

Now find `A[1][2]`.

1. Skip 2 columns: `j = 2` → `2 * 3 = 6 elements`
    
2. Move down 1 row → `+1` element
    
3. Total skipped = `6 + 1 = 7 elements`
    
4. Multiply by `W = 2` → `7 * 2 = 14`
    
5. Add base address: `200 + 14 = 214`
    

✅ So `A[1][2]` is at address **214**.

---

### 🔹 Column-Major vs Row-Major

- **Row-major**: `L0 + (i * N + j) * W`
    
- **Column-major**: `L0 + (j * M + i) * W`
    

That’s the **key difference** — which index is multiplied by the “big dimension.”

---

### 🔹 Language Usage

- **C / C++ / Java** → strictly **row-major**
    
- **Fortran / MATLAB** → use **column-major**
    
- This choice is fixed per language; the compiler generates code accordingly.
    

---


You’ve got it — this explanation is exactly how **row-major** and **column-major mappings** differ when flattening a 2D array into 1D memory. Let me cleanly summarize and highlight the **core idea + formulae** so you have a crisp "formula sheet" in your head:

---

### **Row-major mapping (used in C/C++)**

- Elements are stored **row by row**.
    
- Address of element `A[i][j]` is:
    

LOC(A[i][j])=L0+(i⋅n+j)⋅wLOC(A[i][j]) = L_0 + \Big( i \cdot n + j \Big) \cdot w

Where:

- L0L_0 = base address
    
- nn = number of columns
    
- ww = size of each element (in bytes)
    
- i,ji, j = row and column indices
    

👉 Here **row index `i` dominates first** (because we skip entire rows).

---

### **Column-major mapping (used in Fortran, MATLAB)**

- Elements are stored **column by column**.
    
- Address of element `A[i][j]` is:
    

LOC(A[i][j])=L0+(j⋅m+i)⋅wLOC(A[i][j]) = L_0 + \Big( j \cdot m + i \Big) \cdot w

Where:

- mm = number of rows
    
- Rest same as above.
    

👉 Here **column index `j` dominates first** (because we skip entire columns).

---

### **Comparison:**

- **Row-major** → first `i` then `j` → scanning **left-to-right across a row**.
    
- **Column-major** → first `j` then `i` → scanning **top-to-bottom down a column**.
    
- Both require the same number of operations (two multiplications + one addition).
    
- Choice depends on **compiler/language convention** (C = row-major, Fortran = column-major).
    

---

✅ A mental trick:

- **Row-major = Rows are continuous** in memory.
    
- **Column-major = Columns are continuous** in memory.

Do you want me to also show you a **visual mapping table** (like a memory layout diagram for a `3x4` matrix in both row-major and column-major) so you can quickly see the difference?
