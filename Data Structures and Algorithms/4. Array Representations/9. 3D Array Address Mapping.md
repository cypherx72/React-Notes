Nice ðŸ‘Œ Youâ€™ve nailed the logic. Let me polish this into a clean **reference note for 3D arrays** using exactly the same _general method_ you used for 4D.

## ðŸ”¹ 3D Array Address Mapping

Suppose we have array:

A[L][M][N]A[L][M][N]

Element size = `w` bytes  
Base address = `L0`  
Indices = (i,j,k)(i, j, k)

### **Row-Major Order (left â†’ right)**

Start from the **first index** and multiply by the product of all remaining dimensions.

LOC(A[i][j][k])=L0+(iâ‹…(Mâ‹…N)+jâ‹…N+k)â‹…wLOC(A[i][j][k]) = L_0 + \Big( i \cdot (M \cdot N) + j \cdot N + k \Big) \cdot w

âœ… Explanation:

- ii â†’ outermost dimension â†’ multiply by Mâ‹…NM \cdot N
    
- jj â†’ middle dimension â†’ multiply by NN
    
- kk â†’ innermost dimension â†’ taken as is
    

---

### **Column-Major Order (right â†’ left)**

Start from the **last index** and multiply by the product of all dimensions before it.

LOC(A[i][j][k])=L0+(kâ‹…(Lâ‹…M)+jâ‹…L+i)â‹…wLOC(A[i][j][k]) = L_0 + \Big( k \cdot (L \cdot M) + j \cdot L + i \Big) \cdot w

âœ… Explanation:

- kk â†’ last dimension â†’ multiply by Lâ‹…ML \cdot M
    
- jj â†’ second dimension â†’ multiply by LL
    
- ii â†’ first dimension â†’ taken as is
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaway (Row vs Column Major)

- **Row-major (C/C++)** â†’ **left â†’ right** weighting
    
- **Column-major (Fortran/MATLAB)** â†’ **right â†’ left** weighting
    

So instead of saying "first row, then column" (which only makes sense in 2D),  
ðŸ‘‰ Think in terms of **left-to-right vs right-to-left multiplication of dimensions**.

Would you like me to also **expand one concrete example** (say A[2][3][4]A[2][3][4]) and actually compute the memory offset for a few elements (e.g., `A[0][0][0]`, `A[1][2][3]`) in both **row-major and column-major** so you can _see how they differ_ step by step?
