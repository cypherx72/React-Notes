Here's a **clean, structured revision summary** of the lecture on **C/C++ fundamentals** with an emphasis on **Arrays**, tailored for a course in _Data Structures using C and C++_:

---

## 🧠 **Purpose of This Section**

- To **revise C/C++ programming concepts** essential for learning data structures.
    
- While the course is primarily in **C**, concepts are also shown in **C++**.
    
- **Knowing C is sufficient**, but **knowing C++ is an added advantage**.
    

---

## 🔁 **Topics Covered in This Section**

This section focuses on a quick revision of the following topics:

- ✅ Arrays (basic introduction)
    
- 🧩 Structures (in C)
    
- 🎯 Pointers
    
- 🔗 Reference parameter passing (in both C & C++)
    
- 🏛️ Classes, Constructors, and Templates (C++ only)

## 🧮 **Introduction to Arrays in C/C++**

### 📘 Definition:

An **array** is a **collection of similar data elements** stored under a **common name**.

### 🧾 Declaration Example:

```c
int A[5];
```

- `int`: type of elements
    
- `A`: name of array
    
- `[5]`: size of array (number of elements)
    
- Accessed using indices: `A[0]` to `A[4]` (index starts at 0)
    

### 💾 Memory Usage:

- If `int` = 2 bytes, total space = `5 * 2 = 10 bytes`
    
- All 5 integers are stored **contiguously** in memory
    

---

## 🏗️ **Memory Layout in C Program**

- C program memory is divided into:
    
    - **Code Section**
        
    - **Stack** (for local variables like arrays)
        
    - **Heap** (for dynamically allocated memory)
        
- Local arrays (e.g., declared in `main`) are created on the **stack**.
    

---

## 🔡 **Array Initialization**

### 💡 Static Initialization:

```c
int B[5] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
```

- Combines declaration and initialization.
    
- Values automatically assigned to respective indices.
    

### 🧠 Accessing Elements:

```c
printf("%d", B[0]);  // Prints 2
```

---

## 🔁 **Looping Through Arrays**

### 📌 Using a `for` loop:

```c
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d ", B[i]);
}
```

- Iterates over all elements from `B[0]` to `B[4]`
    
- Common method to **traverse** or **manipulate** array elements
    

---

## 🧾 **Summary of Key Points**

- ✅ Arrays group similar data elements together
    
- ✅ Indexing starts from 0
    
- ✅ Declared in functions → stored in **stack memory**
    
- ✅ Can be **declared** and **initialized** together
    
- ✅ `for` loops are commonly used to iterate through arrays

## 🔜 What's Next?

This was a **revision preview** of arrays. In future sections, you’ll explore:

- Dynamic arrays
    
- Multi-dimensional arrays
    
- Operations like search, sort, insert, delete
    
- Advanced usage in data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.)

## 🔢 C++ Arrays - Basics and Memory

### 📌 Array Declaration

```cpp
int A[5]; // Creates an array of size 5 (indices 0–4)
```

### 📥 Storing Values

```cpp
A[0] = 12;
A[1] = 15;
A[2] = 25;
```

### 📐 Memory Usage

- Typical modern compilers allocate **4 bytes** per `int`.
    
- So, `int A[5]` occupies `5 * 4 = 20 bytes`.
    

```cpp
cout << sizeof(A); // Outputs: 20
```

---

## 📤 Accessing Array Elements

```cpp
cout << A[1] << endl; // Outputs: 15
printf("%d\n", A[2]); // Outputs: 25 (C-style printing)
```

> 📝 You can mix `cout` and `printf`, but include `#include <cstdio>` if needed.

---

## ✅ Array Initialization

### Direct Initialization

```cpp
int A[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}; // Size inferred: 5
```

### Skip Size

```cpp
int A[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}; // Size inferred: 7
```

### Partial Initialization

```cpp
int A[10] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}; // Remaining filled with 0
```

### Single Zero Initialization

```cpp
int A[10] = {0}; // All elements become 0
```

---

## 🔁 Displaying Arrays

### Using For Loop

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    cout << A[i] << endl;
```

### Using Range-Based For Loop (C++11+)

```cpp
for (int x : A)
    cout << x << endl;
```

---

## 🛠 Dynamic Size (Variable Size Arrays)

### Taking Size from User

```cpp
int n;
cin >> n;
int A[n]; // VLA (Variable Length Array), C99 and some C++ compilers
```

> ❗ Not all compilers support VLAs in C++. Cannot initialize VLA at declaration:

```cpp
int A[n] = {2, 4, 6}; // ❌ Error
```

### Workaround

- Assign using loop or manually:
    

```cpp
A[0] = 2;
// or
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    cin >> A[i];
```

> 🔥 Garbage values may appear in uninitialized positions (even 0 is considered garbage if you didn’t set it).

---

## ⚠️ Key Limitations and Notes

- **VLAs**: Compiler-dependent in C++.
    
- **Initialization**: Only static arrays can be initialized inline.
    
- **Garbage Values**: Any value not explicitly set is unpredictable.
    
- **For Each Loop**: Works only when array size is known at compile time (might work for VLAs depending on compiler).
