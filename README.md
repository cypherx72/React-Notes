# ðŸ“˜ Welcome to My GitHub Notes Repository

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains my personal notes on various tech topics â€” organized, structured, and ready to learn from.

> ðŸ§  **For the best reading and navigation experience, I highly recommend opening this repo in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).**

Obsidian turns these Markdown notes into a powerful, interactive knowledge base â€” with linking, search, and a clean interface that makes studying way easier.
