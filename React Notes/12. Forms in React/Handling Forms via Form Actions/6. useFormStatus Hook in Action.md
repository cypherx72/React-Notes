Using the `useFormStatus` hook from `react-dom` is a clean and efficient way to manage form submission states, especially when dealing with form actions in React. This approach allows you to create a reusable `Submit` component that automatically adjusts based on the form's submission status. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you implemented this:

---

### 1. **Create the `Submit` Component**
You created a new component called `Submit.jsx` to encapsulate the submit button logic. This component uses the `useFormStatus` hook to determine the form's submission status.

```javascript
// Submit.jsx
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';

export default function Submit() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();

  return (
    <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

---

### 2. **Use the `Submit` Component in the Form**
In your `NewOpinion` component, you replaced the hardcoded submit button with the reusable `Submit` component.

```javascript
// NewOpinion.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useActionState } from 'react'; // Assuming useActionState is used here
import Submit from './Submit'; // Import the Submit component

function NewOpinion() {
  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(async (prevState, formData) => {
    // Your form submission logic here
    // Example: await addOpinion(formData);
  }, null);

  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      {/* Form fields go here */}
      <Submit /> {/* Use the Submit component */}
    </form>
  );
}

export default NewOpinion;
```

---

### 3. **How `useFormStatus` Works**
The `useFormStatus` hook provides information about the status of the form in which it is used. Specifically:
- **`pending`**: A boolean value that is `true` while the form is being submitted and `false` otherwise.
- **Other properties**: The hook also provides access to the form's `data`, `method`, and `action`, but `pending` is the most commonly used property.

By using `pending`, you can dynamically disable the submit button and update its text to indicate the submission status.

---

### 4. **Benefits of This Approach**
- **Reusability**: The `Submit` component can be reused across multiple forms in your application.
- **Consistency**: Ensures a consistent UI for form submissions (e.g., disabled buttons, loading text).
- **Simplicity**: Reduces boilerplate code by abstracting the submission logic into a separate component.

---

### 5. **Testing the Implementation**
When you tested the implementation:
- Entered valid data into the form.
- Clicked the submit button.
- Observed that the button was disabled and its text changed to "Submitting..." while the form was being processed.
- Once the submission was complete, the form was reset, and the new opinion appeared in the UI.

---

### 6. **Optional Enhancements**
To further improve the user experience, you could:
- **Add a Loading Spinner**: Display a spinner inside the button while the form is being submitted.
- **Error Handling**: Show an error message if the submission fails.
- **Success Message**: Display a success message after the form is successfully submitted.

Example with a loading spinner:
```javascript
// Submit.jsx
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';

export default function Submit() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();

  return (
    <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? (
        <>
          <span className="spinner"></span> Submitting...
        </>
      ) : (
        'Submit'
      )}
    </button>
  );
}
```

---

### 7. **Why Not Use `pending` from `useActionState`?**
While you could use the `pending` value returned by `useActionState`, the `useFormStatus` hook provides a more modular and reusable approach. It decouples the submission status logic from the form action logic, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.

---

### Final Thoughts
By leveraging the `useFormStatus` hook, you created a clean and reusable solution for managing form submission states. This approach aligns with React's philosophy of composability and reusability, making your codebase more maintainable and scalable. Great job! ðŸš€
