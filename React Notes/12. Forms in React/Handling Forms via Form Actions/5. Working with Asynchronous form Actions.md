To enhance the user experience during form submission, you can disable the submit button while the form is being processed. This prevents multiple submissions and provides visual feedback to the user that the form is being submitted. Here's how you can achieve this in your React component:

1. **Track the Submission State**: Use a state variable to track whether the form is currently being submitted.

2. **Disable the Submit Button**: Conditionally disable the submit button based on the submission state.

3. **Update the UI**: Ensure the UI reflects the submission state, such as showing a loading indicator or disabling the button.

Here's how you can implement these steps:

### Step 1: Track the Submission State

First, import the necessary hooks from React and set up a state variable to track the submission status.

```javascript
import React, { useState, use } from 'react';
import { OpinionsContext } from './OpinionsContext'; // Adjust the import path as necessary

function NewOpinion() {
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const { addOpinion } = use(OpinionsContext);

  // Your existing form handling logic...
}
```

### Step 2: Disable the Submit Button

Modify your form's submit button to be disabled based on the `isSubmitting` state.

```javascript
<button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
  {isSubmitting ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
</button>
```

### Step 3: Update the Form Submission Logic

Update your form submission logic to set the `isSubmitting` state before and after the submission process.

```javascript
async function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  setIsSubmitting(true);

  try {
    // Assuming you have form data stored in state or refs
    const formData = {
      title: /* your title value */,
      body: /* your body value */,
      username: /* your username value */
    };

    await addOpinion(formData);
    // Clear form or other success actions
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Submission error:', error);
    // Handle error (e.g., show error message)
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
  }
}
```


This setup ensures that the submit button is disabled while the form is being processed, providing clear feedback to the user and preventing multiple submissions. Adjust the form fields and state management as per your actual form structure and requirements.
