### ⚠️ Limitations of CSS Transitions & Animations

While **CSS transitions** and **animations** are powerful, they hit real-world **limitations** when you're building modern UIs in React.

#### 1. ❌ No Exit Animations with Just CSS

- **Problem:** When a component (e.g., a modal) is removed from the DOM via conditional rendering:
    
    ```jsx
    {isModalOpen && <Modal />}
    ```
    
    ...it disappears **instantly**, so you **can’t animate its exit** with pure CSS.  
    There's no “before-unmount” hook in plain CSS.
    

#### 2. ⚙️ Complex UI Animations are Painful

- Examples:
    
    - Tab indicator bar sliding across tabs
        
    - Animated layout shifts
        
    - Chained sequences (e.g., staggered items)
        

Yes, they’re _possible_ in CSS, but get **very verbose and hard to manage**.

#### 3. 🧠 Lack of Realism

- CSS animations are **linear and rigid**.
    
- Physics-based animation (like spring-based motion or natural easing) is hard to emulate.
    
- Compare two arrows rotating:
    
    - One looks fine with CSS.
        
    - The other with **spring physics** looks **alive**, **real**, and **intuitive**.

### 💡 The Solution: **Framer Motion**

Framer Motion is the **React-first animation library** that:

- Supports **mount and unmount** animations effortlessly.
    
- Lets you build **realistic, physics-based** animations.
    
- Is easier and cleaner than handling edge cases with raw CSS.

### 🧪 Getting Started with Framer Motion

#### 📦 Step 1: Install

```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

If you're using **CodeSandbox**, just add it via the **Dependencies** tab.

### 🧰 What's Next?

You'll explore Framer Motion in a **dedicated playground** with the core concepts:

- `motion` components
    
- `animate`, `initial`, `exit` props
    
- `transition` and `variants`
    
- And more advanced features down the road

### 🚀 Takeaway

Use CSS for:

- Simple hover/fade/slide effects
    
- Basic UI transitions already in the DOM
    

Use **Framer Motion** for:

- Entrance & exit animations
    
- Realistic motion (springs, bounces)
    
- Choreographed UI changes (multi-element animations)
