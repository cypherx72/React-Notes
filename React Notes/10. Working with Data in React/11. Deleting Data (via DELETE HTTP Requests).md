### 1. **Handling Place Removal**:

- The user can remove a place by clicking on it in the selected places box. However, the app currently doesn't send a request to the backend to delete the place.
    
- To enable this functionality, the `handleRemovePlace` function needs to be updated to send a **DELETE request** to the backend, just like the add-place functionality.
    
- The function is turned into an **asynchronous function**, and the state is updated **optimistically** by removing the place from the local state before the request is sent. This makes the UI appear responsive and up-to-date right away.
    

### 2. **Optimistic Updating for Deletion**:

- Just like when adding a place, optimistic updating is used here. The local state (`userPlaces`) is immediately updated by filtering out the place that was removed.
    
- This change is done **before** sending the request to the backend, and then the updated state is sent to the backend using `updateUserPlaces`. The place is removed by filtering out the place from the current state using its unique `ID`.
    

### 3. **Handling Asynchronous Requests**:

- The `handleRemovePlace` function is an **async function**, which means we can `await` the backend request before proceeding. This ensures that the update happens correctly and in sync with the backend.
    

### 4. **Dependencies in `useCallback`**:

- The updated `userPlaces` state should be added as a **dependency** in the `useCallback` hook’s dependencies array. This is crucial because it ensures the `handleRemovePlace` function is recreated whenever `userPlaces` changes. This guarantees that the updated list of places is sent to the backend.
    

### 5. **Error Handling**:

- The **try-catch** block is used again to handle potential errors. If the deletion request fails, the previous state (`old userPlaces`) is restored by rolling back the change, and an error message is shown to the user.
    
- The `ErrorUpdatingPlaces` state is updated with an error message, which is then displayed in the UI.
    

### 6. **Testing the Removal Logic**:

- The speaker demonstrates that the deletion functionality works as expected. If the backend request succeeds, the place is removed from the UI. If the request fails (simulated by using an invalid URL), the UI rolls back to the previous state, and an error message is displayed.
    
- This shows how optimistic updates help provide a smooth user experience, even when something goes wrong.
    

### 7. **Next Steps – Fetching Data on Load**:

- The last part of the app that needs attention is the **data fetching logic**. Currently, the app doesn’t fetch the user’s places when it loads. This would be the next step to complete the functionality and ensure that the app is displaying the correct user data when the user returns.
    


### Step-by-Step Example: Removing Places

1. **UI Setup**: You have a list of places in your UI, and each place can be removed by clicking on it.
    
2. **Optimistic Updating**: Before sending the delete request to the backend, update the state immediately to reflect the UI change, i.e., remove the place from the list visually. If the request fails, roll back the change.
    
3. **Error Handling**: If something goes wrong during the request, display an error message and roll back the UI to its previous state.
    

### Example Code:

```javascript
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [userPlaces, setUserPlaces] = useState([]); // List of places
  const [errorUpdatingPlaces, setErrorUpdatingPlaces] = useState(null); // Error state

  // Async function to remove a place
  const handleRemovePlace = useCallback(async (placeId) => {
    // Step 1: Optimistically update the UI by removing the place from the list
    const oldUserPlaces = [...userPlaces]; // Save the old state for rollback

    const updatedPlaces = userPlaces.filter(place => place.id !== placeId);
    setUserPlaces(updatedPlaces); // Update the UI immediately

    // Step 2: Send the request to the backend to delete the place
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/places/${placeId}`, {
        method: 'DELETE', // DELETE request to remove the place
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Failed to delete place');
      }

      // Optionally, you can handle a successful response (e.g., logging or showing a success message)
    } catch (error) {
      // Step 3: Roll back the state if there was an error
      setUserPlaces(oldUserPlaces); // Restore the previous state (before deletion)
      setErrorUpdatingPlaces({
        message: error.message || 'Failed to delete place',
      }); // Set error state to display error message
    }
  }, [userPlaces]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Places</h1>
      {errorUpdatingPlaces && (
        <div className="error-modal">
          <h2>Error: {errorUpdatingPlaces.message}</h2>
          <button onClick={() => setErrorUpdatingPlaces(null)}>Close</button>
        </div>
      )}
      <ul>
        {userPlaces.map(place => (
          <li key={place.id}>
            {place.name} <button onClick={() => handleRemovePlace(place.id)}>Remove</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **State Management**:
    
    - `userPlaces`: Stores the list of places the user has selected.
        
    - `errorUpdatingPlaces`: Stores any error messages related to the deletion operation.
        
2. **handleRemovePlace Function**:
    
    - The function is wrapped in `useCallback` to memoize it and avoid unnecessary re-creations of the function.
        
    - It accepts a `placeId` to identify the place to be removed.
        
3. **Optimistic UI Update**:
    
    - Before sending the request to the backend, we immediately remove the place from the UI by filtering out the place from `userPlaces`. This provides instant feedback to the user.
        
    - The previous state (`oldUserPlaces`) is stored in case we need to roll back if the request fails.
        
4. **Sending the Delete Request**:
    
    - A `DELETE` request is sent to the backend using `fetch`. We use the `placeId` to specify which place to delete.
        
    - If the request fails (e.g., network error, server error), an exception is thrown, and we catch it in the `catch` block.
        
5. **Error Handling**:
    
    - If the request fails, we roll back the `userPlaces` state to its previous state (before deletion).
        
    - An error message is set in `errorUpdatingPlaces`, which can be displayed in a modal or alert.
        
    - The error modal can be dismissed by clicking the "Close" button.
        
6. **Rendering the UI**:
    
    - The places are displayed in a list. Each place has a "Remove" button next to it that triggers `handleRemovePlace` to delete the place.
        
    - If an error occurs, an error modal is shown with the error message.
        

### Summary:

- **Optimistic updating** is applied to both adding and removing places, ensuring the UI updates immediately for a faster, more responsive experience.
    
- **Error handling** is important to ensure that any failed request (e.g., network issues) doesn't leave the user confused.
    
- The next task is to implement the logic to **fetch user places** when the app loads, completing the functionality.
    

This approach makes the app feel smooth and responsive while handling failures in a user-friendly way.
