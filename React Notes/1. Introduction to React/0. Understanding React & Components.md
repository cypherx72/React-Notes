### **What is React?**

- React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI).
    
- UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images.
    
- React lets you combine these into reusable, nestable components.
    
- From websites to phone apps, every screen can be broken down into components.
    

---

### **What are Components?**

- Components are the core building blocks of any React UI.
    
- They allow you to structure your UI in a modular, reusable way.
    
- In traditional HTML, you'd write UI like this:
    

```jsx
<article>
  <h1>My First Component</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li>
    <li>Defining a Component</li>
    <li>Using a Component</li>
  </ol>
</article>
```

- React allows you to turn this into a custom component like:
    

```jsx
<TableOfContents />
```

- Internally, the same HTML tags (`<article>`, `<h1>`, etc.) are still used.
    

---

### **Why Use Components?**

- **Reusability**: Write once, use anywhere (e.g., `<Button />`, `<Navbar />`).
    
- **Scalability**: As your app grows, components keep your code organized.
    
- **Community**: Thousands of free components are available (e.g., [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)).
---

### **Defining a Component**

- In older web development practices, HTML came first and JS was added for interactivity.
    
- Today, interactivity is the default — and React supports that shift directly.
    
- A React component is a JavaScript function that returns markup.
    

---

### **Example: Your First Component**

A React component is a JavaScript function that returns **markup** (JSX).

```jsx
// App.js

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  );
}
```


#### **Key Steps:**
1. **Export the component** (`export default`) so it can be used elsewhere.  
2. **Define a function** (`function Profile()`) with a **capitalized name**.  
3. **Return JSX markup** (HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript).  

> ⚠️ **Pitfalls**:  
> - Component names **must start with a capital letter**.  
> - Multi-line JSX **must be wrapped in parentheses** `()`.


- This `Profile` function is a React component.
    
- It returns a single image element to be rendered in the UI.
    
- You can use `<Profile />` anywhere in your React tree.
    

---

### **Using Components Inside Other Components**
You can nest components like HTML tags.  

#### **Example: A Gallery of Profiles**
```jsx
function Profile() {
  return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing Scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

#### **What the Browser Sees:**
```html
<section>
  <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
</section>
```

### Nesting and Organizing Components

Components are regular JavaScript functions, so you can keep multiple components in the same file. This works well when components are small or closely related. If the file becomes too crowded, you can move components like Profile to separate files (you'll learn about imports later).

When Profile components are rendered inside Gallery - potentially multiple times - we call Gallery the parent component and each Profile a child component. This demonstrates React's power: define a component once, then use it anywhere as many times as needed.

#### Important Pitfall
While components can render other components, you must never nest their definitions:

```jsx
export default function Gallery() {
  // 🔴 Never define a component inside another component!
  function Profile() {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

This approach causes performance issues and bugs. Instead, always define components at the top level:

```jsx
export default function Gallery() {
  // ...
}

// ✅ Correct: Top-level component
function Profile() {
  // ...
}
```

### Components All the Way Down
Your React application starts with a "root" component, typically created automatically when you begin a project. In environments like CodeSandbox or frameworks like Next.js, this is often defined in pages/index.js.

React applications typically use components throughout the entire UI hierarchy. You'll use components not just for reusable elements like buttons, but also for larger sections like sidebars, lists, and even complete pages. This component-based organization works well even for elements used only once.

React frameworks extend this concept further. Rather than starting with an empty HTML file and having React manage everything with JavaScript, these frameworks generate HTML automatically from your React components. This enables your app to display content before JavaScript finishes loading.

That said, many websites use React selectively to enhance existing HTML pages. These implementations might have multiple root components rather than a single one for the entire page. React can be adopted incrementally - you can use as much or as little as your project requires.

### Recap
Let's review the key points about React components:

- React enables creation of reusable UI components

- Every UI element in a React app is a component

- React components are standard JavaScript functions with two special characteristics:

  1. Their names always start with capital letters
  2. They return JSX markup

---

### **Importing and Exporting Components**

- React components are meant to be **reusable** and **composable**.
    
- As your project grows, it makes sense to **split components into different files**.
    
- This keeps files **organized**, and components **easier to reuse** across your project.
    

---

### **The Root Component File**

- In small apps, multiple components might live in a single file like `App.js`.
    
- Example:
    

```jsx
// App.js

function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

- `Gallery` is the default export and uses the `Profile` component internally.
    

---

### **Why Split Components Into Separate Files?**

- Makes the UI more **modular** and **maintainable**.
    
- Easier to:
    
    - Swap different landing components
        
    - Move UI parts around
        
    - Reuse components in different pages/screens
        

---

### **Steps to Move Components to Separate Files**

1. **Create a new `.js` file** (e.g., `Gallery.js`)
    
2. **Export** components from that file
    
3. **Import** them wherever needed
    

---

### **Gallery.js**

```jsx
// Gallery.js

function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

- `Gallery` is exported as the **default** export.
    
- `Profile` is used inside but **not exported**, so it can't be used elsewhere.
    

---

### **App.js (Using the Exported Component)**

```jsx
// App.js

import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Gallery />
  );
}
```

- `Gallery` is imported as a **default import**.
    
- This is now the root component of the app.
    

---

### **Note: .js Extension is Optional**

```jsx
import Gallery from './Gallery';   // Works fine
import Gallery from './Gallery.js'; // Also valid
```

- Omitting `.js` is common in React projects.
    
- Including it is closer to native ES Module syntax.
    

---

### **Exporting Multiple Components from a Single File**

- You **can’t have more than one default export** in a file.
    
- You **can** have multiple **named exports**.
    

---

### **Update Gallery.js to Export `Profile` as Well**

```jsx
// Gallery.js

export function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

- `Profile` is now a **named export**.
    
- `Gallery` remains the **default export**.
    

---

### **App.js (Importing Both Default and Named Exports)**

```jsx
// App.js

import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
import { Profile } from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Profile />
  );
}
```

- `Gallery` is a **default import**
    
- `Profile` is a **named import** (requires `{}`)
    

---

### **Recap**

- A **root component** is usually your app’s entry point (`App.js` or a page in Next.js).
    
- Use **default exports** for components meant to be the "main" export of a file.
    
- Use **named exports** for any additional components.
    
- A file can have:
    
    - **One default export**
        
    - **Multiple named exports**
        
- To import:
    
    - **Default export:** `import Component from './File'`
        
    - **Named export:** `import { Component } from './File'`
        
- Avoid mixing styles in a single file if it causes confusion — pick what fits your team's preference.
