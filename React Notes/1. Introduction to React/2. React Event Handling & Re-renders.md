## 🧩 React Event Handling & Synthetic Events

### 1. Adding Event Listeners in React

- In React, event listeners are added as **props** to JSX elements.
    
- Event names use **camelCase**, such as `onClick`, `onChange`, `onMouseEnter`.
    
- React wraps native events in a **SyntheticEvent** to ensure consistent behavior across browsers.
    

**Example:**

```jsx
function App() {
  function handleClick() {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

> ⚠️ **Avoid invoking the handler directly**:  
> ❌ `onClick={handleClick()}` will execute immediately.  
> ✅ `onClick={handleClick}` ensures it runs on click.([React](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Responding to Events - React"))

### 2. Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

- Use an **arrow function** to pass arguments without immediate invocation.
    

**Example:**

```jsx
function handleClick(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

<button onClick={() => handleClick("John")}>Click Me</button>;
```

### 3. Understanding SyntheticEvent in React

- React's `SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event.
    
- It normalizes event properties and behavior, ensuring consistency across different browsers.
    
- Each event handler receives a `SyntheticEvent` object.([reactjs-bot.github.io](https://reactjs-bot.github.io/react/docs/events.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "SyntheticEvent - React"), [Angular Minds](https://www.angularminds.com/blog/react-synthetic-events-for-efficient-event-handling?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is Synthetic Event in React - Angular Minds"))
    

**Common Properties:**

- `bubbles`: Indicates if the event bubbles up through the DOM.
    
- `cancelable`: Indicates if the event is cancelable.
    
- `currentTarget`: The element to which the event handler is attached.
    
- `defaultPrevented`: Indicates if `preventDefault()` was called.
    
- `target`: The original source element of the event.


**Common Methods:**

- `preventDefault()`: Prevents the default action associated with the event.
    
- `stopPropagation()`: Stops the event from bubbling up the DOM.
    
- `isDefaultPrevented()`: Checks if `preventDefault()` was called.
    
- `isPropagationStopped()`: Checks if `stopPropagation()` was called.
    
- `persist()`: Removes the event from the pool, allowing asynchronous access.
    

> 🧠 **Note**: React uses event pooling for performance. After the event callback executes, the `SyntheticEvent` is reused, and its properties are nullified. If you need to access the event asynchronously, call `e.persist()`.([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49500255/warning-this-synthetic-event-is-reused-for-performance-reasons-happening-with?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Warning: This synthetic event is reused for performance reasons ..."))

## ⚙️ Component Execution & Re-Renders

### 1. How React Determines UI Updates

- React uses a **Virtual DOM** to optimize UI updates.
    
- When a component's state or props change, React re-renders the component and compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one.
    
- Only the differences (diffs) are updated in the actual DOM, a process known as **reconciliation**.
    

### 2. What Triggers a Component Re-Render?

- **State changes** via `useState` or `useReducer`.
    
- **Props changes** received from a parent component.
    
- **Parent component re-renders**, causing child components to re-render as well.

## 🧠 Managing State with `useState`

- React's `useState` hook allows functional components to manage state.
    

**Syntax:**

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

- `state`: The current state value.
    
- `setState`: Function to update the state and trigger a re-render.
    

**Updating State Based on Previous State:**

```jsx
setState(prevState => prevState + 1);
```

> 🔄 **Note**: State updates are asynchronous and may be batched for performance. To ensure you're working with the latest state, use the functional form of `setState` when the new state depends on the previous state.

## 📜 Rules of Hooks in React

- **Only call hooks at the top level** of your React functions. Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
    
- **Only call hooks from React function components** or custom hooks.
    
- All built-in hooks start with `use` (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`).

## 🧬 Summary

|Topic|Key Takeaways|
|---|---|
|**React Events**|Use camelCase props like `onClick`, `onChange`.|
|**Synthetic Events**|Unified cross-browser event object with `e.nativeEvent` fallback.|
|**Event Pooling**|React reuses event objects for performance; use `e.persist()` if needed.|
|**State Management**|Use `useState` for managing component state; updates trigger re-renders.|
|**Reconciliation**|React updates only the parts of the DOM that have changed.|
|**Hooks Rules**|Call hooks at the top level of React functions; don't call them conditionally.|
