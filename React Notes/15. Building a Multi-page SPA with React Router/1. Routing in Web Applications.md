#### **1. What is Routing?**  
- Routing allows different URL paths (e.g., `/welcome`, `/products`) to display different content.  
- Without routing, a website remains staticâ€”users canâ€™t navigate to different "pages" via URL changes.  

#### **2. Traditional Multi-Page Applications (MPAs)**  
- **How it works:**  
  - Each URL path (`/home`, `/about`) requests a new HTML file from the server.  
  - The browser reloads entirely, fetching new content via HTTP requests.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Slower user experience due to full-page reloads.  
  - Breaks user flow with noticeable lag.  

#### **3. Single-Page Applications (SPAs) & Client-Side Routing**  
- **How SPAs work:**  
  - Only **one initial HTML request** is made.  
  - JavaScript (e.g., React) dynamically updates the content without full page reloads.  
- **Client-Side Routing:**  
  - JavaScript **monitors URL changes** and renders different components accordingly.  
  - Creates the **illusion of navigation** without server requests for new HTML.  
  - Example: Clicking a link updates the URL and displays new content **without a full refresh**.  

#### **4. Why Use Routing in React?**  
- Enables **multi-page-like behavior** while staying within an SPA.  
- Improves **user experience** (faster transitions, no full reloads).  
- Allows **bookmarking/shareable URLs** for different views.  

#### **5. Key Takeaways**  
- **Traditional Routing:** Server sends new HTML on each URL change.  
- **SPA Routing:** React dynamically swaps components based on URL changes.  
- **Benefits:** Smoother UX, faster navigation, and retained SPA advantages.  

This approach will be implemented in the course using Reactâ€™s routing capabilities. ðŸš€
