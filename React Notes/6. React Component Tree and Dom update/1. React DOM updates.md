## 🧬 React Component Execution Order (Function Component)

### 🧱 1. **JSX + Virtual DOM Tree Creation**

- React **parses your JSX** and builds a **Virtual DOM tree**.
    
- Custom components and HTML elements are nodes in this tree.
    

---

### 🔁 2. **Component Instantiation**

For **each component**:

1. **Function is invoked** (`MyComponent()`).
    
2. **Props are passed** into the function.
    
3. **Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`) are registered** in the order they appear.
    

---

### 🧠 3. **Function Execution**

- React **executes the component function** (but not event handlers yet).
    
- Any local variables, `useMemo`, and logic inside run _at this moment_.
    
- The return statement produces JSX.
    

---

### 🛠️ 4. **JSX → React.createElement()**

- JSX is transformed into **React elements** under the hood (before runtime).
    
- This structure is then compared with the **previous Virtual DOM tree** (if any).
    

---

### 🔍 5. **Diffing & Reconciliation**

- React compares the **new Virtual DOM** with the **previous one**.
    
- It figures out **what changed** (via keys, element types, props, etc.).
    

---

### 🎯 6. **DOM Updates**

- React **efficiently updates the real DOM** (only changed parts).
    
- Browser paints the changes on the screen.
    

---

### ⏳ 7. **Run Side Effects**

- `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, etc. run **after the paint phase**.
    
- They don’t block rendering.
    
- React batches and schedules them accordingly.
    

---

### ⚡ 8. **Event Handlers Wait for Triggers**

- Functions like `onClick`, `onChange`, etc. are **defined but not executed** during rendering.
    
- They are only invoked **when the user interacts**.
    

---

### 🔄 9. **Re-render if Needed**

- Any `setState`, `useReducer`, or `prop` changes **trigger a re-render**, repeating the cycle above.
    

---

## ✅ So in Summary:

```
JSX → Virtual DOM → Component function call (props + hooks)
→ JSX return → Virtual DOM diff → DOM update
→ Side effects run → Event handlers await interaction
→ Re-render on updates
```

#### **Component Tree Example**

**App**  

├── Header  
├── Counter  
│   ├── IconButton → Icon  
│   ├── CounterOutput  
│   └── IconButton → Icon  

- The tree ends when no more custom components are left to process.  

---

#### **Debugging and Logging**

- You can add logging to all components to check if they were rendered correctly.  
- Opening **Developer Tools** shows the execution order:  
   - `App → Header → Counter → IconButton → Icon`  
- This matches the structure of the component tree.

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

✔️ React creates a **component tree** based on the component structure.  
✔️ React processes components **top-down**.  
✔️ State is registered and functions are created but not executed until needed.  
✔️ JSX code is translated into JavaScript and rendered as DOM elements.  
✔️ Props are forwarded to child components during execution.
