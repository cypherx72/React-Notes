## 🌳 **React Component Tree**

- React builds a **component tree** when rendering components.  

- Components are **executed top-to-bottom** and React forms a **parent-child relationship** in the tree.  

- The **App component** is the root component, and other components (e.g., `Header`, `Counter`) are its children.  

- React executes component functions step-by-step:

    - Registers state → Creates functions (but does NOT execute them yet) → Executes JSX code → Returns JSX code for rendering.

### 🔄 **Component Execution Flow**

1. React starts by executing the **App component** (the root).  

2. If the App component returns other components (`Header`, `Counter`), React executes them next.  

3. Custom components are identified by **capitalized names** (`Header`, `Counter`).  

4. If a component includes other custom components, React will execute them recursively.

## 🛠️ **React Profiler (Developer Tools)**

- Use **React Developer Tools** (installed as a browser extension) to analyse component rendering.  

- The **Profiler tab** helps you understand:  

    - Which components are rendering.  
    - Why they are rendering.  
    - How often they are rendering.  

---
### 🚀 **How to Use the Profiler**

1. Open **DevTools** → Go to **"Profiler"**.  

2. Click **"Start Profiling"** → Interact with the app.  

3. Click **"Stop Profiling"** → Analyze results.

## 🔥 **Flame Graph Chart**

- Shows the **order of component execution** and their relationships.  
- The **root component** (App) is at the top → Child components are below it.  
- **Colored components** = Components that re-rendered.  
    - If a component is not colored → It didn’t re-render.  

***Example* :

- Incrementing the counter only updates the **Counter component** → App component does NOT re-render.  
- Components that depend on the changed state (like `IconButton`, `CounterOutput`) will re-render.  
- **Parent components** do NOT automatically re-render when child components update.  


---

## 📊 **Ranked Chart Mode**

- Displays **only the components that re-rendered** during the profiling session.  

- Highlights the **root cause** of the re-render (e.g., `Counter component` because state changed).  

- Example: If the state of the `Counter component` changes →  

    - `IconButton`, `CounterOutput`, and `Icon` components re-render.  


---

## ⚙️ **Settings and Debugging**

- Enable **"Record why each component rendered"** in Profiler settings to get detailed insights.  

- After enabling this:  

    - Hover over components → See **why they re-rendered** (e.g., state or prop change).  
    - If caused by state change → "One hook changed" will be shown in the profiler details.

## 🏆 **Key Takeaways**  

✅ React builds a component tree from parent to child.  
✅ Re-rendering happens when **state** or **props** change.  
✅ Parent components don’t re-render when child components update.  
✅ Use the **Profiler** to identify unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.
