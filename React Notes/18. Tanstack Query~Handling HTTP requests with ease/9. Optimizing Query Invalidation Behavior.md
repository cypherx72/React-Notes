## The Problem

When deleting an event from the details page:
1. We invalidate all event-related queries
2. React Query automatically refetches all active queries
3. This includes the event details query for the page we're currently on
4. Results in a failed 404 request since the event was just deleted

## The Solution

```javascript
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: ['events'],
  refetchType: 'none' // Prevent immediate refetch
});
```

### Key Benefits:
1. **Prevents Unnecessary Requests**:
   - The deleted event's details won't be refetched
   - Avoids 404 errors from trying to fetch deleted resources

2. **Maintains Data Consistency**:
   - Queries are still marked as stale/invalid
   - Will refetch when next needed (e.g., navigating back to events list)

3. **Better Performance**:
   - Eliminates redundant network requests
   - Especially helpful for slow networks

## Implementation Details

### Event Deletion Flow:
1. User clicks delete on EventDetails page
2. Mutation executes and deletes the event
3. On success:
   - All event queries are invalidated (marked stale)
   - No immediate refetch occurs (`refetchType: 'none'`)
   - Navigation to events list occurs
4. Events list component mounts/updates:
   - Queries automatically refetch because they're stale
   - Shows updated list without the deleted event

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Targeted Invalidation**:
```javascript
// Only invalidate the list query
queryClient.invalidateQueries({
  queryKey: ['events', 'list'],
  exact: true
});
```

2. **Conditional Navigation**:
```javascript
// Only navigate if not on the events list already
if (location.pathname !== '/events') {
  navigate('/events');
}
```

3. **Optimistic Updates**:
```javascript
// Immediately remove from cache before deletion
onMutate: async (deletedEventId) => {
  await queryClient.cancelQueries(['events']);
  
  // Remove from all relevant queries
  queryClient.setQueryData(['events', 'list'], old => 
    old.filter(event => event.id !== deletedEventId));
  queryClient.removeQueries(['events', deletedEventId]);
}
```

## Best Practice Recommendation

The `refetchType: 'none'` solution is ideal when:
- You're navigating away from the current view
- You want to avoid unnecessary requests
- You still want to ensure eventual consistency

For most CRUD applications, this pattern provides:
- Clean user experience
- Efficient network usage
- Reliable data synchronization
