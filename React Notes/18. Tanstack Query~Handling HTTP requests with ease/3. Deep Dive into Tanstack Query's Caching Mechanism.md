## Core Caching Behavior
1. **Instant Data Availability**: 
   - When navigating back to a page, data appears immediately from cache
   - Behind the scenes, a fresh request still occurs to check for updates
   - This creates a seamless user experience (no loading spinners) while ensuring data freshness

2. **Visual Demonstration**:
   - With normal network: Data appears instantly while request happens in background
   - With throttled network (Slow 3G): Still instant display of cached data while fresh data loads

## Key Configuration Options

### `staleTime`
- **Purpose**: Controls when Tanstack Query considers cached data "stale"
- **Default**: `0` (immediately stale)
- **Behavior**:
  ```javascript
  useQuery({
    queryKey: ['events'],
    queryFn: fetchEvents,
    staleTime: 5000 // 5 seconds
  })
  ```
  - With `staleTime: 5000`, no background refresh occurs if component re-renders within 5 seconds
  - After 5 seconds, background refreshes will occur when component mounts again

### `gcTime` (Garbage Collection Time)
- **Purpose**: Controls how long unused data remains in cache
- **Default**: `300000` (5 minutes)
- **Behavior**:
  ```javascript
  useQuery({
    queryKey: ['events'],
    queryFn: fetchEvents,
    gcTime: 30000 // 30 seconds
  })
  ```
  - After 30 seconds of inactivity, cached data is purged
  - Next component mount will show loading state while fetching fresh data

## Practical Implications

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - For mostly static data: Increase `staleTime` to reduce unnecessary requests
   - For highly dynamic data: Keep low `staleTime` or use default (0)

2. **Resource Management**:
   - For memory-sensitive apps: Reduce `gcTime` to clear cache faster
   - For better UX: Keep sufficient `gcTime` to avoid frequent loading states

3. **User Experience**:
   - Immediate response from cache
   - Silent background updates
   - No jarring loading states during navigation

## Behind-the-Scenes Process
1. Component mounts â†’ Check cache for matching `queryKey`
2. If cached data exists:
   - Immediately return cached data
   - Check if data is stale (based on `staleTime`)
   - If stale, trigger background refresh
3. If no cached data:
   - Show loading state
   - Fetch fresh data
   - Store in cache
