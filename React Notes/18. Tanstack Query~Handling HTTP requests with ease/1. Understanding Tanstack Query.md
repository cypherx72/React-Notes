Tanstack Query (formerly React Query) is a powerful library that simplifies data fetching and state management in React applications. Let me summarize the key points from your explanation:

## Core Purpose
Tanstack Query helps with:
- Sending HTTP requests
- Keeping frontend UI in sync with backend data
- Managing server state efficiently

## Comparison to Manual Approach
Without Tanstack Query, you might:
- Use `useEffect` and `fetch` to get data
- Manage multiple states manually (`isLoading`, `error`, `data`)
- Write repetitive code in every component that fetches data

## Problems with Manual Approach
1. **Boilerplate Code**: Lots of repetitive state management
2. **Missing Features**:
   - No automatic refetching when window regains focus
   - No built-in caching mechanism
   - No automatic data revalidation
3. **Complexity**: Implementing advanced features manually is challenging

## Benefits of Tanstack Query
1. **Simplified Code**: Reduces boilerplate
2. **Built-in Features**:
   - Automatic caching
   - Background refetching
   - Window focus refetching
   - Data synchronization
3. **Better UX**: Provides more polished user experiences with less effort

## Example Scenario
In your events application:
- Without Tanstack Query: Switching tabs and returning doesn't trigger data refresh
- With Tanstack Query: You get automatic refetching when returning to the tab

## Transition Approach
You'll be converting from a manual `useEffect` + `fetch` implementation to using Tanstack Query's hooks, which will:
1. Eliminate state management boilerplate
2. Add sophisticated caching behavior
3. Improve data synchronization
