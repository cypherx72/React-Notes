- **Definition**: Components designed to work _together_, not in isolation.
    
- **HTML Analogy**:
    
    - `<select>` and `<option>` only make sense when used _together_.
        
- **React Use**: Create multiple tightly-related components that share context/state and can be composed naturally.

### ðŸ§± **Component Structure So Far**

1. **`Accordion.jsx` (the shell)**
    
    ```jsx
    export default function Accordion({ children, className }) {
      return <ul className={className}>{children}</ul>;
    }
    ```
    
    - âœ… Receives children â†’ Custom content injected between tags.
        
    - âœ… Accepts `className` for flexible styling.
        
2. **`AccordionItem.jsx` (one item)**
    
    ```jsx
    export default function AccordionItem({ title, children, className }) {
      return (
        <li className={className}>
          <h3>{title}</h3>
          <div>{children}</div>
        </li>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    - `title`: Prop to display item heading.
        
    - `children`: The body content placed between tags.
        
    - `className`: Optional styling for the item itself.

### ðŸ§ª **Usage Example in App.jsx**

```jsx
<Accordion className="accordion">
  <AccordionItem
    className="accordion-item"
    title="We got 20 years of experience"
  >
    <article>
      <p>
        You can't go wrong with us. We are in the business of planning highly
        individualized vacation trips for more than 20 years.
      </p>
    </article>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem
    className="accordion-item"
    title="We're working with local guides"
  >
    <article>
      <p>
        We are not doing this alone from our office. Instead, we are working
        with local guides to ensure a safe and pleasant vacation.
      </p>
    </article>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### ðŸ’¡ **Why This Matters**

- Provides flexibility in content/layout.
    
- Promotes **custom layout** inside each item (`children` usage).
    
- Separation of concerns: Accordion manages the group, AccordionItem handles each entry.
    
- Currently, there's **no toggle logic** â€“ items donâ€™t collapse/expand yet. Thatâ€™s next.
