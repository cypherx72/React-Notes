### 1. **Props in React Functional Components (FCs)**

- Initially, there’s a warning in TypeScript about props being unused and having an implicit `any` type.
    
- TypeScript warns about code that’s not in use and catches potential issues like implicit `any` types.
    
- The warning about the `any` type highlights that TypeScript can't infer types automatically, which may lead to reduced benefits from TypeScript's strong typing.
    

### 2. **Explicit Type Definition for Props**

- The solution is to explicitly define types for the props object by creating a custom type for the props, such as `items: string[]`.
    
- However, React components also have built-in props, like `children`, which need to be handled as part of the type definition.
    
- React provides a type called `FC` (Functional Component) to help manage these types more effectively.
    

### 3. **Using `React.FC` for Type Safety**

- `React.FC` allows you to define a functional component with its own props while maintaining the default props like `children`.
    
- It’s a generic type, meaning you can specify the custom props your component will receive, alongside the default props like `children`.
    
- You define your custom props inside the angle brackets, ensuring that TypeScript can infer the correct types for `props`.
    

### 4. **Simplified Code with Type Annotations**

- By using `React.FC`, you define the component’s props once and then use them within the component.
    
- TypeScript understands that `props.items` is an array and provides auto-completion for array methods like `.map()`.
    
- The `key` for each list item can be set to the string value from the `items` array.
    

### 5. **Error Handling and Type Safety**

- With type annotations in place, TypeScript ensures that the component is used correctly. For example, if the `items` prop is missing, TypeScript will immediately highlight the error.
    
- By passing `items` with a proper array of strings (e.g., `["Learn React", "Learn TypeScript"]`), all errors are resolved, and you get immediate feedback on incorrect usage.
    

### 6. **Benefits of TypeScript in React**

- **Auto-completion**: The IDE offers auto-completion based on the defined types.
    
- **Error Prevention**: TypeScript prevents you from using components incorrectly by enforcing type checks.
    
- **Clearer Code**: The code becomes more self-descriptive, making it easier to maintain and understand, especially when working with larger codebases.
    

In conclusion, integrating TypeScript with React provides robust type safety, prevents bugs early in development, and enhances the developer experience by offering features like auto-completion and compile-time error checking. The main takeaway here is how to define and use props effectively with TypeScript, making it a powerful tool for managing complex components in React.

## *Example*  

```tsx
import React from "react";

// Define the type for the props
interface TodoProps {
  tasks: string[];
}

const TodoList: React.FC<TodoProps> = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Todo List</h2>
      <ul>
        {props.tasks.map((task, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{task}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TodoList;
```

### Breakdown of the code:

- **TodoProps interface**: We define the props structure here, indicating that `tasks` is an array of strings.
    
- **TodoList functional component**: This component uses `React.FC` and takes the `TodoProps` type, ensuring that TypeScript enforces proper type checking for the props passed to the component.
    
- **Rendering the tasks**: We map through `props.tasks` and display each task inside a `<li>` element. The key is set to the index (this can be improved by using a unique id if you have it).
    

### How to use it:

In your `App.tsx`, you'd call the `TodoList` component like so:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import TodoList from "./TodoList"; // Assuming the path is correct

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const tasks = ["Learn React", "Build a To-Do App", "Master TypeScript"];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Todo App</h1>
      <TodoList tasks={tasks} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Why this works:

- **TypeScript's help**: The interface `TodoProps` ensures that only an array of strings is passed to the `TodoList` component. If you try to pass a different type (e.g., an array of numbers), TypeScript will warn you.
    
- **Simplified component structure**: It helps in maintaining a clean, readable structure by explicitly defining props.
