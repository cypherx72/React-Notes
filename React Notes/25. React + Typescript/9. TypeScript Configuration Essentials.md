The `tsconfig.json` file tells the TypeScript compiler **how to compile your code**. It's critical in any TypeScript project, including React + TypeScript setups.

In React projects:

- You **don‚Äôt manually run the compiler** (`tsc`); it‚Äôs triggered behind the scenes when:
    
    - Starting the dev server
        
    - Running a production build
        

This file customizes how TypeScript behaves during that process.

### üîß Most Important Compiler Options

#### `"target"`

- Sets the **JavaScript version** TypeScript compiles to.
    
- Example: `"es5"` ‚Üí Outputs older JS (wider browser support).
    
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Other tools like **Babel** may further transform the output.
    

#### `"lib"`

- Declares **built-in TypeScript libraries** to use for type definitions.
    
- Example: `"DOM"` allows you to use browser types like `HTMLInputElement`.
    
- ‚ùå Removing `"DOM"` ‚Üí TypeScript will throw errors when using DOM APIs.
    

#### `"allowJs"`

- Lets you **import and use `.js` files** in a `.ts` project.
    
- Useful if mixing plain JavaScript with TypeScript during migration.
    

#### `"strict"`

- Enables **strict type checking** across the project.
    
    - Disallows implicit `any`
        
    - Forces explicit types where inference isn‚Äôt possible
        
    - Turns on multiple safety-related checks
        
- ‚úÖ Should **always be true** unless you have a good reason to disable it.
    

#### `"jsx"`

- Enables support for **JSX syntax** (used in React).
    
- Controls how JSX is compiled (e.g., `"react"`, `"react-jsx"`).
    
- Leave it at the default unless you know you need a specific behavior.

### üß† Bonus Notes

- You can hover over any setting in VS Code to get:
    
    - A quick summary
        
    - A direct link to the official TypeScript documentation
        
- The settings shown in most starter projects are good defaults ‚Äî **only tweak them if you know what you're doing**.
    
- For deeper learning, explore:
    
    - Official docs: [https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig)
        
    - Advanced course modules that dive into each flag
