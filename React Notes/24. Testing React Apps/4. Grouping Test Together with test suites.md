### 🧪 Test Suites vs. Tests in React Testing Library

#### 🧠 Why Group Tests?

As your application scales, you might end up with **dozens, hundreds, or even thousands** of individual tests. To keep things **organized and manageable**, you should **group related tests** into **test suites**.

---

### ✅ What Is a Test Suite?

A **test suite** is a collection of related tests, typically grouped around:

- A specific **feature**
    
- A specific **component**
    
- A **module or functionality**
    

You define a test suite using the global `describe()` function.

---

### 🔧 Syntax for `describe()`

```js
describe('Greeting component', () => {
  test('renders Hello World as a text', () => {
    // Arrange
    render(<Greeting />);
    // Assert
    const helloWorldElement = screen.getByText('Hello World!');
    expect(helloWorldElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  // More tests can be added here
});
```

---

### 🧩 Anatomy of `describe()`

- **First Argument**: A string label for the group (e.g., `"Greeting component"`).
    
- **Second Argument**: A callback function where all related `test()` blocks are placed.
    

---

### 📌 Benefits of Using Test Suites

- Makes test output easier to **read** and **navigate**.
    
- Keeps codebase **clean** and **modular**.
    
- Helps with **debugging** by isolating failing groups.
    
- Great for scaling: multiple `describe()` blocks for different features/components.
    

---

### 🧪 Example Test Output

With the test suite, your terminal output will show:

```
Greeting component
  ✓ renders Hello World as a text
```

---

### 🔁 Default Behavior

If no `describe()` is used, React Testing Library will still group tests automatically, but it’s better to explicitly use `describe()` to stay organized—especially as the codebase grows.

---

## Testing State and User Interaction in React Components

### ✅ Objective

Improve the component and test it in different state scenarios based on user interactions.

---

### 🧠 Component Logic

- Introduced `useState` to manage internal state:
    
    ```js
    const [changedText, setChangedText] = useState(false);
    ```
    
- Renders:
    
    - `"good to see you"` initially.
        
    - `"Changed"` after button click.
        
- Button triggers state update:
    
    ```js
    const changeTextHandler = () => {
      setChangedText(true);
    };
    ```
    

---

### 🧪 Test Strategy: Cover All Meaningful Scenarios

#### 1. **Default Text Rendered**

```js
test('renders good to see you if the button was NOT clicked', () => {
  render(<Greeting />);
  const outputElement = screen.getByText('good to see you', { exact: false });
  expect(outputElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

#### 2. **Updated Text After Click**

```js
test('renders Changed if the button WAS clicked', () => {
  render(<Greeting />);
  const buttonElement = screen.getByRole('button');
  userEvent.click(buttonElement);
  const outputElement = screen.getByText('Changed');
  expect(outputElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

#### 3. **Original Text Not Present After Click**

```js
test('does not render good to see you if the button WAS clicked', () => {
  render(<Greeting />);
  const buttonElement = screen.getByRole('button');
  userEvent.click(buttonElement);
  const outputElement = screen.queryByText('good to see you', { exact: false });
  expect(outputElement).toBeNull();
});
```

---

### 📦 Utilities & Methods Used

- `render()` – to mount the component.
    
- `screen.getByText()` – finds element by visible text.
    
- `screen.getByRole('button')` – semantic element query.
    
- `screen.queryByText()` – returns `null` if not found (used for negative checks).
    
- `userEvent.click()` – simulate user interaction.
    
- `expect(...).toBeInTheDocument()` – check if element exists.
    
- `expect(...).toBeNull()` – check if element does _not_ exist.
    

---

### 🚨 Why This Matters

Without comprehensive tests:

- False positives: broken logic goes unnoticed.
    
- Maintenance risk: hard to refactor with confidence.
    
- Incomplete test coverage: bugs slip through silently.
