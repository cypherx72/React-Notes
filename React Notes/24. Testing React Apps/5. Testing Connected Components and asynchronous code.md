### 🧪 Testing: Multiple Components, Props, and Integration

**Goal:**  
Explore how components interact through props and how to test this interaction using a simple wrapper component.

---

#### 🧩 New Component: `Output`

- A simple presentational (dumb) component to demonstrate prop passing.
    
- It renders a paragraph with `props.children`.
    

```jsx
const Output = (props) => {
  return <p>{props.children}</p>;
};

export default Output;
```

**Purpose:**  
While simple, `Output` simulates a reusable component that could apply styling or layout logic (similar to a `Card` component used earlier in the course).

---

#### 🔁 Update: `Greeting` Component Uses `Output`

- Previously, `Greeting` rendered a `<p>` element directly.
    
- Now, it's refactored to use the `Output` component.
    

```jsx
import Output from './Output';

const Greeting = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Hello World!</h2>
      <Output>It's good to see you!</Output>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Greeting;
```

---

#### ✅ Tests Still Pass

- Existing tests for `Greeting` continue to work even after refactoring.
    
- `render()` from React Testing Library renders the _entire component tree_, not just the top-level component.
    
- Therefore, even though `Output` is a separate component, its content is available to assertions.
    

> 💡 **Note:** This scenario could be seen as a basic integration test since multiple components are involved. However, because `Output` has no logic or state, it’s perfectly fine to test everything together here.

---

#### 🧠 When to Split Tests?

Keep tests together when:

- A component is stateless and purely presentational (like `Output`).
    
- You're testing component _interaction_, not internal logic.
    

Split tests when:

- The child component (like `Output`) becomes complex (e.g., manages state, has its own logic).
    
- You want targeted tests for specific component responsibilities.

## 🔍 **Core Concepts Highlighted**

### ❌ Why You _Shouldn’t_ Use Real HTTP Requests in Tests:

1. **Performance + Cost**: Running tests often means repeated network calls → slow + excessive traffic.
    
2. **Server Risk**: If it's a `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` request, it could unintentionally modify production/test data.
    
3. **Test Reliability**: Your tests shouldn't break just because the server is down or slow.
    
4. **Responsibility Boundary**: You’re not testing whether _`fetch`_ works — that’s the browser’s job. You're testing **your component's behavior** based on possible outcomes of `fetch`.
    

---

## ✅ **What You Should Do Instead**

### 🔁 Mock `fetch` using Jest

You **mock** it so:

- No real request is sent.
    
- You simulate success/error scenarios.
    
- You test how your **component responds**, not how fetch works.
    

```js
// Overriding window.fetch with a mock function
window.fetch = jest.fn();

// Simulate a successful fetch
window.fetch.mockResolvedValueOnce({
  json: async () => [
    { id: 'p1', title: 'First post' }
  ]
});
```

This means:

- When your component calls `fetch`, this mocked version is used.
    
- When `.json()` is called on the fetch response, it resolves to the array of fake posts.
    

---

## 🧪 Benefits for Your Tests

### 🔹 Cleaner + Controlled Testing Environment

You can now write tests that:

- Simulate successful API responses.
    
- Simulate failures (e.g., network error or invalid data).
    
- Don’t need to worry about backend availability.
    

### 🔹 Flexible Test Scenarios

You can do something like:

```js
// Simulate an error
window.fetch.mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('Failed to fetch'));
```

This allows you to test loading states, error states, and retry logic — all without touching the real API.

---

## 🧠 Testing Philosophy Reminder

**Don’t test what you didn’t write.**  
Test _how your code reacts_ to various conditions, not whether external systems do their job.

Here's a **cleaned and structured summary** of the transcript you provided — it wraps up the testing module and suggests next steps for deeper learning:

---

## 📦 Module Summary: Introduction to React Testing

This module served as a **brief introduction to testing in React**, not a full-blown testing course.

### 🔧 Tools Introduced:

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework used under the hood.
    
- **React Testing Library**: Utility for testing React components in a user-centric way.
    

---

## 🔍 Why Not Go Deeper in This Course?

- The course is focused on **React**, not testing in general.
    
- Testing is a **huge topic** — worthy of its own dedicated course.
    
- This module was meant to give you **basic familiarity**, not exhaustive coverage.

## 📚 Want to Learn More?

Here are **recommended resources** for going deeper:

### 🧪 Jest Docs

- Jest is a **general-purpose JavaScript testing tool** (not React-specific).
    
- In the docs, you can learn more about:
    
    - Matchers and assertions
        
    - Async code testing
        
    - Mocking functions and promises
        
- Keep in mind: setup steps are already handled in React projects.

### ⚛️ React Testing Library Docs

- Focused on **React-specific testing strategies**.
    
- Topics covered:
    
    - Query methods (`getBy`, `findBy`, `queryBy`) — with explanations on when to use each.
        
    - Firing user events (e.g. clicks, typing)
        
    - Handling async logic in components
        
    - Core API references and best practices

### 🔄 Additional Resources:

- **React Testing Library Ecosystem**:
    
    - Built-in tools like `@testing-library/user-event`
        
    - Extensions for deeper functionality
        
- **Recommended Add-On**:
    
    - `@testing-library/react-hooks`: Helps test **custom hooks** easily.
        
        - Ideal if you're writing and reusing custom logic in your app.
