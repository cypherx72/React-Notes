### Three Main Categories of Automated Testing

---

#### 1. ✅ **Unit Tests**

- **Scope**: Smallest building blocks (functions, isolated components).
    
- **Goal**: Ensure individual parts of the app work as expected **in isolation**.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Testing a utility function (e.g., `formatDate()`).
        
    - Testing a stateless React component with mock props.
        
- **Usage**:
    
    - **Most common** type of test.
        
    - Projects typically have **many unit tests**.
        
- **React Note**: Sometimes components are hard to isolate (due to props, context, etc.), blurring the line with integration tests.

#### 2. 🔗 **Integration Tests**

- **Scope**: Multiple units/components **working together**.
    
- **Goal**: Test how different pieces integrate and interact.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Rendering a form component that uses child input components and checking form submission logic.
        
    - Testing a page that pulls data via a hook and displays it using a component tree.
        
- **Usage**:
    
    - Fewer than unit tests, but **still important**.
        
    - Especially useful when logic is **shared across components**.

#### 3. 🌐 **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**

- **Scope**: Simulate **real user workflows**.
    
- **Goal**: Test the **entire app flow** from the user's perspective.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Logging in and navigating to a dashboard.
        
    - Filling out a form and receiving a success confirmation.
        
- **Tools**: Cypress, Playwright, Selenium.
    
- **Usage**:
    
    - Less frequent due to **complexity** and **slower execution**.
        
    - Acts as **automated manual testing**.
        
    - Good for catching issues across the full stack (frontend + backend + routing).

### 🔄 Summary

|Test Type|Scope|Frequency|Speed|Focus|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Unit Test|Functions/Components|🔁 Often|⚡ Fast|Isolated correctness|
|Integration|Multi-component|🔁 Moderate|⚡⚡ Medium|Collaboration between units|
|End-to-End|Full user scenarios|🔁 Few|🐢 Slow|Real-world workflows (UI + logic)|

### 🎯 `What to Test & How to Test (Mindset Before Coding)`

---

### 🧩 **What Should You Test?**

- Focus on **small building blocks**:
    
    - Individual **functions**, **React components**, or **hooks**.
        
- Prefer **small, focused tests**:
    
    - Each test should validate **only one behavior or logic path**.
        
    - Makes failures easier to debug and isolate.
        
- Avoid large, complex test cases that cover too many things at once.
    
- Goal: Create a **lot of atomic tests** with **clear purpose**.
    

---

### ⚙️ **How Should You Test?**

- **Test both success & error scenarios**:
    
    - E.g., function returns expected value and throws when given bad input.
        
    - E.g., component renders correctly and shows an error when props are missing or invalid.
        
- **Cover edge cases and rare situations**:
    
    - E.g., empty inputs, large data sets, invalid props, user doing unexpected things.
        
- Tests should simulate **real user interactions** where applicable (especially with components).

> ✅ Think in terms of **"behavior"**:  
> What **should** happen? What **shouldn't** happen?  
> Your tests = proof that these expectations hold.
