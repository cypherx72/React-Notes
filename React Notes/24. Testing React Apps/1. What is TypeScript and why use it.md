### üîπ TypeScript = Superset of JavaScript

- Builds _on top of_ JavaScript.
    
- **Extends** JavaScript syntax with extra features.
    
- Core JavaScript stays the same (e.g. `if`, `for`, objects, etc.).
    
- Unlike libraries like React, TypeScript changes the **language itself**, not just adds functionality.

### üß© Key Feature: Static Typing

- **JavaScript is dynamically typed**: types are determined at runtime.
    
- **TypeScript introduces static typing**: you define types ahead of time.
    

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}
```

- This means:
    
    - You tell TypeScript that `a` and `b` must be numbers.
        
    - TypeScript gives compile-time errors if wrong types are passed.

### ‚ùå The Problem with Vanilla JS

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

- If called as `add("2", "3")`, JavaScript will _concatenate_ strings ‚Üí `"23"`, not `5`.
    
- No warning/error from JS ‚Äî can lead to bugs, especially in large codebases.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Why TypeScript Helps

- **Error prevention**: Catches mistakes during development, not at runtime.
    
- **Code clarity**: You and your team know what types a function expects.
    
- **Scalability**: Helps manage large projects with multiple contributors.

### üì¶ Extra Benefits

- Type annotations aren't just for function parameters ‚Äî can be used on:
    
    - Variables
        
    - Return types
        
    - Objects and arrays
        
    - Custom types and interfaces

## TypeScript Installation and Compilation

**TypeScript** is a _superset_ of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features. You **write TypeScript**, then **compile it to JavaScript** (since browsers don't understand TypeScript natively).

### Installation

Visit: [https://www.typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

#### Local Installation (Recommended per project)

```bash
npm init -y                  # Initializes package.json
npm install typescript       # Installs TypeScript locally
```

#### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g typescript    # (optional) for global access
```

### Compilation

TypeScript must be compiled to JavaScript:

```bash
npx tsc <filename>.ts        # Compiles a single file
```

If no config file (`tsconfig.json`) exists and you run `npx tsc`, TypeScript throws an error because it doesn't know which file(s) to compile.

### Behavior During Compilation

- **Types are stripped**: `:number`, `:string`, etc. do not exist in the compiled JS.
    
- **Defaults to older JavaScript versions**: e.g., `const` becomes `var` unless configured otherwise in `tsconfig.json`.
    
- **Error warnings**: TypeScript throws compile-time errors _but still outputs JavaScript by default_.
    
- IDEs also highlight TypeScript errors before compilation.
    

### Why TypeScript?

- Prevents runtime bugs through _early error detection_.
    
- Helps in large codebases with better code quality, especially with multiple developers.
    
- Makes code self-documenting through type annotations.
