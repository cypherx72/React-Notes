Testing in software development ensures the correctness and stability of your application. There are **two types** of testing commonly used:

---

#### 1. **Manual Testing**

- You **manually interact** with the app in the browser (e.g., clicking buttons, checking features).
    
- It helps you **see what users will see**.
    
- **Pros**: Great for UI validation, real-world interaction.
    
- **Cons**: Time-consuming, error-prone, doesn’t scale with complexity.

#### 2. **Automated Testing**

- You write **code that tests other code**.
    
- React apps often grow large — with many interconnected components and logic — so manual testing isn’t enough.
    
- **Goal**: Automatically test the entire app or key features whenever you make changes.
    
- **Benefits**:
    
    - Ensures **existing features don’t break** after changes (regression testing).
        
    - Allows **quick testing of the whole app** after every change.
        
    - **Works alongside** manual testing (not a replacement).
        
    - Helps catch **errors early** in development.

### Why Automated Testing Matters

- Manual testing alone can’t cover all edge cases.
    
- As your app grows, **untested areas can silently break**.
    
- With automated tests, you can **confidently refactor**, knowing your test suite will catch any unintended breakage.
    
- **Improves code quality**, development speed, and team collaboration.
