#### Problem

We used a custom hook (`useFetch`) to fetch and manage data (`userPlaces`). However, **the editing capabilities (selecting/removing a place) broke** because:

- The state (`userPlaces`) is now managed inside `useFetch`.
    
- Local component functions like `handleSelectPlace` and `handleRemovePlace` can't directly update that state.
    

---

#### Solution

Expose the state updater function (`setFetchedData`) from the custom hook:

```js
return {
  fetchedData,
  isLoading,
  error,
  setFetchedData, // <- exposed for external state updates
};
```

In the consuming component:

```js
const { fetchedData, setFetchedData: setUserPlaces } = useFetch(...);
```

Now, `setUserPlaces` can be used to update the data as needed.

---

#### Optional: Wrapping the State Updater

You can **wrap `setFetchedData` in custom functions** to:

- Add validation
    
- Restrict access or centralize logic
    

---

#### What Happens in Other Components?

Each time you use a custom hook like `useFetch`, a **new, independent state instance** is created—just like `useState`.

✅ So updating the state in one component **won’t** affect others, even if they use the same custom hook.

---

#### Dependency Warning in `useCallback` / `useEffect`

When destructuring a state updater like `setUserPlaces`:

- React can't **guarantee immutability** because it sees it as a generic function.
    
- Add it to the dependency array to **suppress warnings**, even though it technically doesn’t cause re-renders.
    

```js
useCallback(() => {
  // logic using setUserPlaces
}, [setUserPlaces]); // <- safe and avoids warnings
```

#### Final State

- ✅ Add Place works
    
- ✅ Remove Place works
    
- ✅ Reload retains changes
    
- ✅ No console errors
    
- ✅ Fully powered by `useFetch`
