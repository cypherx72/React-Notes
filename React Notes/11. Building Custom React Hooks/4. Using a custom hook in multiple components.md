### Sharing Custom Hooks Across Components in React

#### Why Use Custom Hooks?

- ✅ **Cleaner Components**: Offload logic (like data fetching) to custom hooks.
    
- ✅ **Code Reuse**: Share logic across components that follow a similar pattern (e.g., fetching data, managing loading/error state).
    

---

#### Example: `useFetch` in Another Component

In `AvailablePlaces`, we originally used `useEffect` + `useState` to:

- Fetch data via `fetchAvailablePlaces`
    
- Manage `isFetching`, `error`, and `availablePlaces` state
    

**But this logic is similar to what’s already in `useFetch`.**

---

#### How to Use `useFetch` Here:

```js
import useFetch from '../hooks/useFetch';
import { fetchAvailablePlaces } from '../lib/http';

const {
  isFetching,
  error,
  fetchedData: availablePlaces,
  setFetchedData: setAvailablePlaces
} = useFetch(fetchAvailablePlaces, []);
```

Now we can:

- Remove local `useState` and `useEffect`
    
- Reuse the custom hook for a cleaner implementation
    

✅ Component remains functional  
✅ Code is now DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

---

#### Note on Custom Hook Independence

Each component using `useFetch` gets:

- Its **own isolated copy of state**
    
- Updating state in one component (e.g., `App`) does **not** affect another (e.g., `AvailablePlaces`)
    

---

#### What About the Custom Logic?

`AvailablePlaces` also sorted fetched data by distance using user's position.

That sorting logic must now be **re-applied manually** _after_ data is fetched using `useFetch`.

➡️ Temporarily stored code from the original `useEffect` must be **reinjected appropriately**, likely in a `useEffect` triggered on changes to `availablePlaces`.
