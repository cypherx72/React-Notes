1. **Hooks must be used inside React Component functions or other custom Hooks.**

   - Initially, the rule was that Hooks could only be used inside React Component functions. However, this rule has been expanded to include custom Hooks as well. This flexibility is what allows us to create reusable logic in the form of custom Hooks.

2. **Hooks must not be nested inside conditions, loops, or nested functions.**

   - Hooks must always be called at the top level of a React function to ensure they are called in the same order on every render. This is crucial for React to maintain the state and lifecycle of Hooks correctly.

### **Why Custom Hooks?**

Custom Hooks are a way to **encapsulate and reuse stateful logic** across multiple components. They allow you to extract logic that uses React Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) into a reusable function. This is particularly useful when:

- You have **repetitive logic** across multiple components (e.g., fetching data, managing loading/error states, etc.).

- The logic doesn't return JSX, so it can't be encapsulated in a regular component.

### **Example: Fetching Data**

In your example, you have two components (`App.jsx` and `AvailablePlaces.jsx`) that both:

1. Send an HTTP request.

2. Manage loading and error states.

3. Use `useEffect` to trigger the request.



Instead of duplicating this logic in both components, you can create a **custom Hook** to handle the shared functionality.

### **Benefits of Custom Hooks**

1. **Reusability**: You can reuse the same logic across multiple components without duplicating code.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps your components focused on rendering UI, while the custom Hook handles the logic.

3. **Testability**: Custom Hooks can be tested independently of the components that use them.

4. **Readability**: Makes your components cleaner and easier to understand.

### **Key Takeaways**

- Custom Hooks are **functions that use React Hooks** internally.

- They allow you to **share stateful logic** between components.

- They must follow the **rules of Hooks** (e.g., called at the top level, not inside conditions or loops).

- Custom Hooks are a powerful tool for **code reuse** and **logic abstraction** in React applications.
