React components use _props_ to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

## Familiar props [](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#familiar-props "Link for Familiar props")

Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, `className`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` are some of the props you can pass to an `<img>`: 

```jsx 
function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg"
      alt="Lin Lanying"
      width={100}
      height={100}
    />
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar />
  );
}
```

The props you can pass to an `<img>` tag are predefined (ReactDOM conforms to [the HTML standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-img-element)). But you can pass any props to _your own_ components, such as `<Avatar>`, to customize them. Here’s how!
