### 🔄 What are React Server Components (RSC)?

- **Run on the server only.**
    
- Their code **never reaches the client/browser**.
    
- Executed during:
    
    - **Server request**
        
    - **Build time** (if pre-rendered)
        
- Cannot use **client-only features** like `useState`, `useEffect`.
    

---

### 🧠 What are Client Components?

- Rendered on the **server** first (for HTML output).
    
- Then **hydrated** on the **client** to enable interactivity.
    
- Can use all **React client-side features** (e.g., state, effects).
    

---

### ✅ Default Behavior in Next.js

- **All components are Server Components by default**.
    
- Example:
    
    - A component like `RSCDemo` logs to the **server**, not the browser.
        
    - Shown by checking the terminal logs (`console.log()` output).
        

---

### 🔁 Making a Client Component in Next.js

- Must **explicitly declare** it:
    

```jsx
'use client'
```

- Add this directive **at the top** of the component file to convert it to a **Client Component**.
    

---

### 📁 File Setup Example

- Folder: `/components`
    
    - `RSCDemo.js` → Server Component
        
    - `ClientDemo.js` → (Initially Server Component, made client with `'use client'`)
        
- File: `app/page.js`
    
    - Uses `RSCDemo` and `ClientDemo` inside main page component.

### React Server Components vs Client Components

#### 🧠 Core Concepts

- **React Server Components (RSCs)**:
    
    - Never run in the browser.
        
    - Are rendered **only on the server** or during the build process.
        
    - Their code **never reaches the client**.
        
    - Cannot use client-side features like `useState`, `useEffect`, or context.
        
    - **Default behavior** in special setups like **Next.js**.
        
- **Client Components**:
    
    - Can run on **both the server (initial render)** and **the client (hydration and interactions)**.
        
    - Required for features like state, effects, and interactivity.
        
    - Are the **default** in traditional React setups (e.g., with Vite).
        
    - In server-aware setups (like Next.js), you must explicitly mark them.
        

#### 🚨 How to Mark a Component as a Client Component

At the **very top** of the file:

```js
'use client'
```

- Must be a **top-level directive**.
    
- Can use single or double quotes.
    
- No semicolon is required.
    

#### ✅ Benefits of Server Components

- **Less JavaScript** sent to the client → better performance.
    
- **Data fetching** can happen on the server, reducing browser workload.
    
- Ideal for rendering static content or pages where interactivity isn’t needed.
    

#### ✅ When to Use Client Components

- When you need **interactivity**:
    
    - State (`useState`)
        
    - Effects (`useEffect`)
        
    - Context (`useContext`)
        
- Typically used for buttons, forms, modals, dropdowns, etc.
    

#### 🧪 Behavior in Next.js

- **All components are server components by default**.
    
- Adding `'use client'` opt-ins a file to be client-executed.
    
- Console logs in server components show up in the **server terminal**, not the browser console.
    

#### 🧱 Example Setup

```js
// RSCDemo.js (Server Component by default)
export default function RSCDemo() {
  console.log('Rendered on the server');
  return <p>This is a server component</p>;
}

// ClientDemo.js (Client Component)
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function ClientDemo() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prev => prev + 1)}>+</button>
      <span>{count}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### React Server and Client Components Integration

#### Key Rules:

1. **Server components** can directly include **client components** in their JSX code.
    
2. **Client components** cannot directly include **server components** in their JSX code, with one exception:
    
    - **Client components can accept server components as children.**
        

#### Example 1: Valid Combination (Server → Client)

```jsx
// Server component rendering a client component
import ClientComponent from './ClientComponent';
const ServerComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ClientComponent />
    </div>
  );
};
```

- **Explanation:** This works as server components can render client components.
    

#### Example 2: Invalid Combination (Client → Server)

```jsx
// Client component trying to render a server component
import ServerComponent from './ServerComponent';
const ClientComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ServerComponent />
    </div>
  );
};
```

- **Explanation:** This won't work unless server component is passed as children in the client component.
    

#### Example 3: Client Component Converts Server Component to Client

- When a **server component** is used in a **client component**, the server component gets automatically converted into a **client component**.
    
- This is because Next.js and similar setups convert components used in client components into client components by default.
    

#### Example 4: Force a Server Component with `async`

```jsx
// Mark server component as async
const ServerComponent = async () => {
  return <div>Data fetching...</div>;
};
```

- **Explanation:** **Async functions** are allowed in server components, but not in client components. If you try to use async in a client component, you’ll get an error.
    

#### Valid Alternative: Passing Server Component as Children

```jsx
// Using children to pass server component to client component
<ClientComponent>
  <ServerComponent />
</ClientComponent>
```

- **Explanation:** The server component is rendered on the server, and its output is injected into the client component as children, avoiding the need to mark it as a client component.

Here's a well-organized Obsidian note for this new section on **data fetching with React Server Components**:

---

### 🧠 React Server Components: Data Fetching

#### 📁 Setup:

- **dummy-db.json**: Add this file to your **project root**. Simulates a simple database.
    
- **DataFetchingDemo.js**: A **server component** placed in the `components` folder.
    

---

#### 🔍 Key Observations:

- **Server components** can run `Node.js` code.
    
- Marked as server component because:
    
    - No `"use client"` directive.
        
    - Declared as `async function`.
        
- Async/await is **supported** because execution happens **on the server**, not in the browser.
    

---

#### ✅ Why It Works:

- Server components execute in a **Node.js environment**.
    
- This allows usage of:
    
    - `fs.promises.readFile`
        
    - JSON file reading
        
    - Synchronous and asynchronous Node operations
        
- **Client components can't do this**, because:
    
    - They run in the browser.
        
    - React does **not** support `async` component functions in the client.
        

---

#### 🧩 Real-World Benefit:

> **You no longer need `useEffect` to fetch data from APIs.**

Instead:

- Directly load the data in the server component.
    
- Let React handle rendering with already-fetched data.
    

---

#### 🖼️ Usage in App:

Replace other components (like `ClientDemo` or `RSCDemo`) in `page.js`:

```jsx
import DataFetchingDemo from './components/DataFetchingDemo';

export default function Page() {
  return <DataFetchingDemo />;
}
```

- ✅ This will render the component **with data** directly fetched from the server.
    
- ✅ The HTML already includes the data when it reaches the browser.

#### 📌 Summary:

|Feature|Server Component|Client Component|
|---|---|---|
|Runs in|Node.js (server)|Browser (client)|
|Can use `async`/`await`|✅ Yes|❌ No|
|Node.js APIs (e.g., `fs`)|✅ Yes|❌ No|
|Used for data fetching|✅ Ideal|🚫 Not directly|
