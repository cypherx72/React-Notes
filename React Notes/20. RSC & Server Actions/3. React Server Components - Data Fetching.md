#### 🔍 Key Observations:

- **Server components** can run `Node.js` code.
    
- Marked as server component because:
    
    - No `"use client"` directive.
        
    - Declared as `async function`.
        
- Async/await is **supported** because execution happens **on the server**, not in the browser.
    

---

#### ✅ Why It Works:

- Server components execute in a **Node.js environment**.
    
- This allows usage of:
    
    - `fs.promises.readFile`
        
    - JSON file reading
        
    - Synchronous and asynchronous Node operations
        
- **Client components can't do this**, because:
    
    - They run in the browser.
        
    - React does **not** support `async` component functions in the client.

#### 🧩 Real-World Benefit:

> **You no longer need `useEffect` to fetch data from APIs.**

Instead:

- Directly load the data in the server component.
    
- Let React handle rendering with already-fetched data.
    

---

#### 🖼️ Usage in App:

Replace other components (like `ClientDemo` or `RSCDemo`) in `page.js`:

```jsx
import DataFetchingDemo from './components/DataFetchingDemo';

export default function Page() {
  return <DataFetchingDemo />;
}
```

- ✅ This will render the component **with data** directly fetched from the server.
    
- ✅ The HTML already includes the data when it reaches the browser.

#### 📌 Summary:

| Feature                   | Server Component | Client Component |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Runs in                   | Node.js (server) | Browser (client) |
| Can use `async`/`await`   | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No             |
| Node.js APIs (e.g., `fs`) | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No             |
| Used for data fetching    | ✅ Ideal          | 🚫 Not directly  |
