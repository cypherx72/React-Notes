#### ðŸ§  Summary

React includes advanced features like **React Server Components**, **Server Actions**, and the **`use()` hook** with Promises. However, these **do not work in vanilla React projects** (e.g., those created with **Vite**) because they rely on server-side execution and require code-splitting capabilities.

#### ðŸ›‘ Why They Donâ€™t Work in Vanilla React

- Vanilla React only runs in the **browser**, with **no server-side environment**.
    
- These features need:
    
    - A **server-side runtime**
        
    - A build system that **splits client vs server code**
        
- Standard React tools (like Vite) donâ€™t provide that.
    

#### ðŸš€ How to Use Them

To use these features, you need a framework that supports:

- Full-stack rendering
    
- Code splitting
    
- Server-side environments
    

The most common choice is **Next.js**, which:

- Builds on React
    
- Supports server-side rendering and static generation
    
- Splits code automatically into client/server bundles
    
- Supports `page.js` for routing in multipage apps
