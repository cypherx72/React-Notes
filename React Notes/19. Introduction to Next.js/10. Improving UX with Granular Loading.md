## üéØ Improving UX with Granular Loading (React Suspense)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem with Global `loading.js`

- The fallback UI (`loading.js`) **replaces the entire page** during loading.
    
- Even static elements (like the header) vanish until the data is fetched.
    
- Bad UX: Users don‚Äôt know if the site is still working or if it's broken.

## üõ†Ô∏è Better Solution: **Granular Suspense with Component Splitting**

### ‚úÖ Steps

1. **Extract the data-fetching logic** into a separate async component.
    
2. Use **React's `Suspense` component** to wrap that async child.
    
3. Define a `fallback` UI only for the data-fetching part.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Example Code Walkthrough

#### 1. Extract Meals Component

```jsx
// In page.js

async function Meals() {
  const meals = await getMeals();
  return <MealsGrid meals={meals} />;
}
```

#### 2. Use Suspense for Fine-Grained Control

```jsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import classes from './page.module.css'; // Moved loading styles here

export default function MealsPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header /> {/* Loads instantly */}
      <Suspense fallback={<p className={classes.loading}>Fetching meals...</p>}>
        <Meals />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}
```

## üí° Key Concepts

### ‚úÖ React Suspense (Built-in Feature)

- Handles loading states for components that suspend (e.g., wait for async data).
    
- Accepts a `fallback` prop: what to show **while waiting**.
    
- Next.js fully supports and integrates this pattern.
    

### ‚úÖ Why This Is Better

|Global `loading.js`|Suspense with Component Splitting|
|---|---|
|Entire screen is replaced|Only data-fetching part shows fallback|
|Header disappears|Header remains visible instantly|
|Less granular control|Full control over UI composition|

---

## üì¶ Extra Notes

- You can reuse the loading styles from `loading.module.css` by copying them into `page.module.css` or another shared file.
    
- `Suspense` can be nested multiple times for **multi-stage loading UX**.
    
- `loading.js` is just **syntactic sugar** over React Suspense‚Äîit wraps your page with Suspense under the hood.
    

---

## üöÄ Final Result

- Static UI (like headers) render instantly.
    
- Only dynamic data sections (e.g., meals) show a loading state.
    
- Page feels faster and more interactive thanks to **streaming behaviour**.

### üö® The Problem

You're handling **image uploads in a Next.js application**, and you're making a **critical architectural choice**:

> **Where should uploaded images be stored?**

You rightly **avoid storing images in the database** ‚Äî because:

- Databases are not optimized for large binary files.
    
- Performance degrades when reading/writing large blobs.
    
- Scaling becomes painful and expensive.
    

---

### ‚úÖ The Solution: Store Images in the File System

The plan is to:

- Save images in the `public/images` folder.
    
- Store only the **path (not the image)** in the database.
    
- Make sure images are publicly accessible.
    
- Avoid filename collisions and preserve file extensions.
    

---

## üì¶ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. **Get the File Extension**

```js
const extension = meal.image.name.split('.').pop();
```

This extracts `.jpg`, `.png`, etc. from the uploaded image.

---

### 2. **Generate a Unique File Name**

```js
const fileName = `${meal.slug}.${extension}`;
```

Using the meal's slug ensures a consistent and unique name.

---

### 3. **Create a Writable Stream with Node's `fs` Module**

```js
import fs from 'node:fs';

const stream = fs.createWriteStream(`public/images/${fileName}`);
```

This sets up a writable stream to store the image.

---

### 4. **Convert the Uploaded Image to a Buffer**

```js
const arrayBuffer = await meal.image.arrayBuffer();
const buffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer);
```

Browser APIs give you an `ArrayBuffer`, but Node wants a `Buffer`.

---

### 5. **Write the Image to the File System**

```js
stream.write(buffer, (error) => {
  if (error) throw new Error('Saving image failed!');
});
```

You handle errors gracefully here. No silent failures.

---

### 6. **Update Meal Object with Image Path**

```js
meal.image = `/images/${fileName}`;
```

Notice: **no `public/` prefix** in the path, because Next.js serves the `public/` folder as the web root.

---

### 7. **Save the Meal in the Database**

```js
db.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO meals (title, summary, instructions, creator, creator_email, image, slug)
  VALUES (@title, @summary, @instructions, @creator, @creator_email, @image, @slug)
`).run(meal);
```

- You're using parameterized queries for **SQL injection protection**.
    
- This syntax with `@fieldName` maps cleanly to JS objects.
    

---

### 8. **Redirect the User After Submission**

```js
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

redirect('/meals');
```

This improves UX. You avoid showing a blank form after submission.

### ‚úÖ Summary: Best Practices Followed

|Practice|‚úÖ Followed?|
|---|---|
|Avoiding BLOBs in DB|‚úÖ|
|Using Streams for Performance|‚úÖ|
|Async/await for File Ops|‚úÖ|
|Converting `ArrayBuffer` to Node `Buffer`|‚úÖ|
|Secure SQL Insertion|‚úÖ|
|Redirect after submission|‚úÖ|

### üöÄ Going Further (If You Want to Polish It)

- **File type validation** (only accept `jpeg`, `png`, etc.).
    
- **Max file size limit** (to prevent abuse).
    
- Use a **UUID instead of slug for filenames** if uniqueness is mission-critical.
    
- Clean up **old images** when meals are deleted/updated.
    
- **CSRF protection** if you later expose this outside a trusted frontend.
