- **File-based Routing**:
    
    - Next.js uses the **file and folder structure** inside the `app/` directory to define routes.
        
    - Each **folder** represents a **route segment**, and each `page.js` inside that folder renders the actual page content.
        
- **Creating a New Route (`/about`)**:
    
    1. Inside `app/`, create a new folder named `about`.
        
    2. Inside `about/`, create a `page.js` file.
        
    3. Export a React component from `page.js`.  
        Example:
        
        ```js
        export default function AboutPage() {
          return <main>About Us</main>;
        }
        ```
        
- **Important Notes**:
    
    - The **component name** inside `page.js` can be anything. The filename and structure define the route, not the function name.
        
    - If the folder lacks `page.js`, visiting that route will return a **404 page**.
        
    - Wrapping content in elements like `<main>` can help apply consistent styles if global or layout-level CSS is used.
        
- **Outcome**:
    
    - Visiting `localhost:3000/about` will now render the JSX from `about/page.js`.
        
- **Key Takeaway**:
    
    - Next.js routes are **declarative**—you define them simply by creating folders and files. No need for external routing libraries like React Router.



**Navigating Between Pages in Next.js**

- **Problem with Regular `<a>` Tags**:
    
    - Using standard anchor (`<a>`) tags to link between internal pages causes **full page reloads**.
        
    - This breaks the **Single Page Application (SPA)** behaviour, making the browser reload the entire document from the server.
        
- **Introducing the `Link` Component**:
    
    - Next.js provides a special `Link` component from `next/link` to preserve SPA behaviour.
        
    - It enables **client-side navigation** between routes, keeping the experience fast and seamless.
        
- **How to Use `Link`**:
    
    ```js
    import Link from 'next/link';
    
    export default function HomePage() {
      return (
        <main>
          <p>
            <Link href="/about">About Us</Link>
          </p>
        </main>
      );
    }
    ```
    
    - You can style it using `className`, and it behaves like a regular link while maintaining SPA characteristics.
        
- **Result**:
    
    - Navigation becomes instant.
        
    - The **refresh icon doesn’t flash**, indicating no full page reload.
        
    - Behind the scenes, the content is still pre-rendered on the server, but it's **hydrated and managed on the client**, giving us the best of both SSR and SPA.
