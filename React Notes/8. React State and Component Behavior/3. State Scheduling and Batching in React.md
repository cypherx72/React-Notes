Understanding how state updates are scheduled and executed by React is crucial for avoiding common bugs and improving performance.

## 🔄 **How State Updates Are Scheduled**

1. When you call a state updating function like `setChosenCount`:

   - The state update is **scheduled** — not executed immediately.

   - React schedules the update and will process it during the next render cycle.  

2. If you log the state **immediately after updating it**:

   - You will see the **old state** because the new state is not yet applied.  

   - The state will update only when the component **re-executes**.  


---

### 🧪 **Example – Why Immediate Logging Fails**

```jsx
setChosenCount(10);
console.log(chosenCount); // Logs the old state, not 10
```

- The state update (`setChosenCount(10)`) is **scheduled**.  

- The `console.log()` runs before the next render, so it shows the old state.  


---

## 🛠️ **Solution – Function Form of State Updates**

React allows you to use a **function form** for state updates:
  

```jsx
setChosenCount((prevChosenCount) => prevChosenCount + 1);
```

### ✅ **Why Function Form Works**

- The function receives the latest state value (`prevChosenCount`).  

- React guarantees that the state value passed to the function is **up-to-date**.  

- If multiple state updates are scheduled together, they will be processed **in order** and React will always pass the correct latest value.  

---

### 🔥 **Example – Incorrect Way:**

If you try to set state based on the old value directly:

```jsx
setChosenCount(newCount);
setChosenCount(newCount + 1);
```

- The second `setChosenCount` will not work correctly because `newCount` is stale.

- It will add `1` to the old state instead of the updated value.  

### ✅ **Correct Way Using Function Form:**

```jsx
setChosenCount(newCount);

setChosenCount((prevChosenCount) => prevChosenCount + 1);

```

- The second update will work correctly because it gets the latest state value.

- The second `setChosenCount` is guaranteed to execute **after the first update**.  

---

## 🏷️ **State Batching**

If multiple state updates happen **within the same function**:

- React will **batch** them together into a single update cycle.

- This prevents multiple component re-renders and makes the update more efficient.

### 🧪 **Example – State Batching:**

```jsx
setChosenCount(10);
setOtherState(20);
```

- React will only execute **one render** even though two state updates are called.

- This improves performance since React avoids unnecessary renders.

---

### 🚀 **Why Batching is Efficient:**

- Without batching → Two state updates = Two component re-renders  

- With batching → Two state updates = **One component re-render**

## 🌟 **Key Takeaways:**

✅ State updates are **scheduled**, not executed instantly.  
✅ Use **function form** for state updates based on the previous state.  
✅ Multiple state updates within a function are **batched** to reduce renders.  
✅ React ensures state updates are processed **in order** and efficiently. 😎
