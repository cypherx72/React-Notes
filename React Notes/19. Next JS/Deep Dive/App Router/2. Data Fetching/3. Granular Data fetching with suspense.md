## 🧠 **The Problem**

- When selecting a **new month** in the app, there is **no visible feedback** that data is being fetched.
    
- Although Next.js has a global `loading.js`, it **does not get triggered** if the route stays the same and only the **data changes**.
    
- This is a **bad user experience**, as it appears like nothing is happening.
    

---

## 🔧 **Why loading.js Doesn’t Help Here**

- `loading.js` only shows when **navigating to a new page**, not when data inside a page is just being updated.
    
- Since the route doesn’t technically change (you’re still on the same page), **Next.js reuses the previously loaded page** and doesn’t show the fallback again.

## ✅ **The Solution: React Suspense for Granular Loading**

React Suspense allows you to define **fine-grained loading boundaries**.

---

## 🧱 **Steps to Fix with Suspense**

### 1. **Move data-fetching to a separate server component**

Create a component like:

```jsx
// FilteredNews.jsx
async function FilteredNews({ year, month }) {
  let news;
  if (year && !month) {
    news = await getNewsForYear(year);
  } else if (year && month) {
    news = await getNewsForMonth(year, month);
  }

  if (!news || news.length === 0) {
    return <p>No news found.</p>;
  }

  return <NewsList news={news} />;
}
```

### 2. **Use `Suspense` in the page component**

Wrap the `FilteredNews` component in a `Suspense` boundary:

```jsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import FilteredNews from './FilteredNews';

<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading news...</p>}>
  <FilteredNews year={year} month={month} />
</Suspense>
```

Now when new data is being fetched for the same route, you’ll get **loading feedback**.

---

## 📂 **Repeat for Other Parts (e.g., Header)**

- Create another async component like `FilterHeader`, which also fetches data (e.g., available years).
    
- Wrap **that too** in its own `Suspense`:
    

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading filter...</p>}>
  <FilterHeader year={year} month={month} />
</Suspense>
```

This means **each section loads independently** and shows its own fallback.

---

## 💥 Bonus: Add Error Handling

If a user selects an **invalid year/month**, handle it with a conditional and `throw`:

```js
if (
  (year && !availableYears.includes(year)) ||
  (month && !availableMonths.includes(month))
) {
  throw new Error('Invalid filter');
}
```

Let this bubble up to your `error.js`.

---

## ⚖️ Granularity = Flexibility

You can:

- Wrap **multiple components** in one `Suspense` if they should load together.
    
- Or keep them **separate**, allowing one to render while another is still loading.
    

---

## 🧠 Final Takeaway

> If you're just using `loading.js`, you're limited to full-page loading.  
> **React Suspense gives you surgical control** over which parts of your UI show loading states, improving perceived performance and user experience.
