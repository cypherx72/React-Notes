### **Option 1: Client-Side Data Fetching in Next.js**

In this approach, we are fetching data from the backend API on the client side, using the `fetch` function within the `useEffect` hook. This method is commonly used in React applications, and it's also applicable in Next.js.

### **Steps to Implement Client-Side Fetching**:

1. **Start Backend Server**:
    
    - Navigate to the `backend` folder in your terminal and run `npm start` to start the backend API server.
        
    - Open a separate terminal window, go to the root project folder, and run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js app.
        
2. **Fetch Data in NewsPage Component**:
    
    - Inside the `NewsPage` component (or wherever you want to display the news), replace the static `Dummy_News` with a dynamic API request.
        
    - Use the `useEffect` hook to initiate the request to the backend server (running on `localhost:8080`).
        
3. **Code Implementation**:
    
    - The `useEffect` hook will trigger a fetch request to `localhost:8080/news` to retrieve the news data.
        
    - Since `useEffect` cannot be `async`, a helper function `fetchNews` is used inside it to handle the asynchronous fetch request.
        
    
    ```javascript
    import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
    
    const NewsPage = () => {
      const [news, setNews] = useState(null);
      const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
      const [error, setError] = useState(null);
    
      useEffect(() => {
        const fetchNews = async () => {
          try {
            const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/news');
            if (!response.ok) {
              throw new Error('Failed to fetch news');
            }
            const data = await response.json();
            setNews(data);
          } catch (error) {
            setError(error.message);
          } finally {
            setIsLoading(false);
          }
        };
    
        fetchNews();
      }, []);
    
      if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
      if (error) return <p>{error}</p>;
    
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>News</h1>
          {news && news.map((item, index) => (
            <div key={index}>
              <h2>{item.title}</h2>
              <p>{item.content}</p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    };
    
    export default NewsPage;
    ```
    
4. **Handle State**:
    
    - `isLoading` is used to manage the loading state (while waiting for the API response).
        
    - `error` stores any error message if the request fails.
        
    - `news` stores the fetched data.
        
5. **Display UI**:
    
    - If `isLoading` is `true`, display a loading message.
        
    - If there’s an error, display the error message.
        
    - If data is fetched successfully, display the news content.
        
6. **Client-Side Rendering**:
    
    - The data fetching occurs on the **client side**.
        
    - The use of `useEffect` ensures that the request is only made once the component is mounted on the client.

### **Challenges of Client-Side Fetching in Next.js**:

- **SEO Concerns**: Since data is fetched after the page is loaded on the client, the initial HTML sent to the browser won't contain the data, affecting SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
    
- **Performance**: If the page relies on external data (like news articles), users will experience a delay before the data is fetched, leading to a less optimal user experience.
    
- **Hydration Mismatch**: If the page content is generated differently on the server and client (e.g., based on data fetching), it can lead to "hydration" issues, where React tries to re-render the page with different content after the initial load.
    

---

### **Next Steps**:

While client-side fetching works and is fine for certain scenarios, it’s not the most optimal approach in Next.js, especially for SEO and performance reasons. In the next sections, you might explore **server-side data fetching** (e.g., `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`), which allows you to fetch the data on the server during the initial page load.

---

**Option 2: Server-Side Data Fetching with Next.js**

In the previous approach, we used client-side data fetching to load news data. While this worked, it had some downsides. Specifically, when inspecting the source code of the page, we couldn't find the actual news content because it was fetched on the client-side. This approach does work but isn't the most optimal for Next.js.

**Why is client-side fetching not ideal in Next.js?**

Next.js is built around **React server components**, which have some powerful advantages for fetching data. Unlike client-side React components, server components can return **promises** directly. This means you can use `async/await` within these components, simplifying data fetching and enabling server-side rendering, which leads to better performance and SEO benefits. This is one of the core advantages of Next.js over traditional React apps.

**Refining the Code for Server-Side Fetching**

In this revised approach, we will convert the component back to a **server component** (removing `use client`), and perform the data fetching directly in the component function using `async`/`await`. We will remove the need for `useEffect` and `useState` as Next.js will automatically wait for the data before rendering the page, which means we don’t have to worry about rendering undefined states or showing loading/error states as we did in the client-side approach.

### Key Changes:

1. **No More `useState` or `useEffect`:** We no longer need these hooks since the component is now running on the server, and Next.js will wait for the data to be fetched before rendering the page.
    
2. **Async/Await in the Component:** The `fetch` request is now directly inside the component, and we can await the response.
    
3. **Error Handling:** We add simple error handling using a throw error in case the fetch fails.
    

### Benefits:

- **SEO Benefits:** Since the data is fetched on the server, the news content will be included in the initial HTML response, which improves SEO.
    
- **Simplified Code:** Without the need for multiple states and `useEffect` handling, the code is cleaner and more efficient.
    

**In Conclusion:**  
Server-side data fetching in Next.js should be your go-to approach. It ensures better performance, SEO, and overall cleaner code by leveraging Next.js’s server-side capabilities.

**Option 3: Direct Database Access in Next.js with React Server Components**

Now that we’ve moved the data fetching directly into the server component, we can further simplify our architecture by eliminating the need for a separate backend server entirely. Instead of fetching data via HTTP requests, we can directly query the database from within the Next.js project itself, leveraging **React Server Components**.

### Why Move Database Access into the Next.js Project?

In scenarios like the one presented here, where you control both the front-end and back-end (i.e., you’re working with a database), there may not be a strong reason to maintain a separate backend server. By accessing the database directly within your Next.js app, you can eliminate the additional HTTP request round-trip and simplify your architecture.

### Steps to Access Database Directly:

1. **Move the Database into the Next.js Project**: We begin by moving the `data.db` SQLite file into the project’s root directory, where it can be easily accessed by the Next.js application.
    
2. **Install Dependencies**: Next, install a dependency to handle database interactions. In this case, we use `better-sqlite3`, a lightweight and synchronous SQLite package that works perfectly with Next.js because it operates on the server-side.
    
    ```bash
    npm install better-sqlite3
    ```
    
3. **Set Up Database Connection**: In the `lib/news.js` file, we import the `better-sqlite3` package and configure it to connect to the SQLite database.
    
    ```js
    import SQL from 'better-sqlite3';
    
    const db = new SQL('data.db');
    ```
    
4. **Fetching Data from the Database**: Instead of using dummy data, we can now write a simple SQL query to fetch the news directly from the database. Using the `prepare` method, we prepare a query to fetch all news entries and then execute it with the `all()` method.
    
    ```js
    const getAllNews = () => {
      const stmt = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM news');
      return stmt.all();  // Returns an array of news
    };
    ```
    
5. **Using the Data in the Component**: In the `page.js` file, instead of making an HTTP request, we call the `getAllNews` function directly to fetch the data from the database.
    
    ```js
    import { getAllNews } from '../lib/news';
    
    const NewsPage = () => {
      const news = getAllNews(); // Directly fetches the news from the DB
      return (
        <div>
          {news.map((item) => (
            <div key={item.id}>
              <h3>{item.title}</h3>
              <p>{item.content}</p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    };
    
    export default NewsPage;
    ```
    

### Benefits of This Approach:

- **Simplified Architecture**: By removing the extra backend server, we reduce complexity and avoid unnecessary HTTP requests, making the application more efficient.
    
- **Server-Side Execution**: The database is accessed only on the server, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure and that client-side JavaScript doesn’t interfere with the backend.
    
- **Performance**: By eliminating an extra HTTP request, data fetching becomes faster, reducing latency and improving the overall user experience.
    

### Conclusion:

By utilizing **React Server Components** and directly accessing the database from the Next.js application, we streamline the process of fetching data. This eliminates the need for a separate backend server, reduces complexity, and improves performance—all while leveraging the strengths of server-side rendering for better SEO and user experience.
