While directly accessing the database in Next.js (using React Server Components) is a great way to optimize the data-fetching process, you also need to consider how to handle loading states. In real-world applications, fetching data often takes time, and it's important to show the user some feedback while waiting for the data to arrive.

### Simulating a Slower Database with Async/Await

Although the `better-sqlite3` package we’re using is synchronous and doesn't require `async/await`, we can simulate a slower database or backend response by adding a delay. This helps in demonstrating how to handle loading states.

1. **Adding Delay to Simulate Slow Data Fetch**:  
    We add an artificial delay using a promise constructor with `setTimeout`. This helps simulate a database or backend that responds slowly.
    
    ```js
    const getAllNews = async () => {
      const stmt = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM news');
      const news = stmt.all();
      
      // Simulate a 2-second delay to simulate a slower response
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
      return news;
    };
    ```
    
2. **Handling Async Functions**:  
    Since `getAllNews` is now asynchronous due to the added delay, it returns a promise. To handle this in the Next.js page, we need to update the page to await the result.
    
    In the React Server Component (e.g., `page.js`), simply mark the function as `async` and await the result:
    
    ```js
    const NewsPage = async () => {
      const news = await getAllNews();  // Wait for the news to load
      return (
        <div>
          {news.map((item) => (
            <div key={item.id}>
              <h3>{item.title}</h3>
              <p>{item.content}</p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```
    
3. **Improving User Experience with Loading States**:  
    When the data is loading, it's important to show feedback to the user. Next.js makes it easy to add a **loading fallback** using a special `loading.js` file.
    
    To implement this:
    
    - Create a `loading.js` file in the same folder as your page (or a higher level if needed).
        
    - In this file, export the JSX that you want to show while the data is being fetched (e.g., a loading spinner or text).
        
    
    ```js
    // loading.js
    export default function Loading() {
      return <div>Loading news...</div>;  // You can replace this with a spinner or skeleton loader
    }
    ```
    
    This will automatically show the "Loading" message while the news data is being fetched.
    
4. **Optimized Navigation and Fallbacks**:  
    After implementing the loading fallback, the user experience improves significantly. When navigating to the news page, users will see a loading state until the data is fetched. This prevents the feeling that the page is unresponsive.
    
    - If a user navigates away from the page and then comes back (e.g., going from the News page to Archive and back), Next.js will render the loading fallback immediately, providing smoother transitions.
        
    
    ### Conclusion:
    
    - **Async/Await**: Even though `better-sqlite3` is synchronous, adding artificial delays with async functions helps simulate slower data fetching, which is useful for demonstrating how to handle loading states.
        
    - **Loading States**: With the `loading.js` file, Next.js offers a clean and straightforward way to implement loading feedback, significantly improving the user experience during data fetching.
        
    - **Better UX**: By showing a loading state while fetching data, you reduce the likelihood of users feeling like the app is unresponsive. This ensures smoother navigation and better user engagement, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations like fetching from a database.

## 🚀 **1. When You Own the Database – Ditch the API Calls**

If your app owns the database (e.g. SQLite in your local project), you **don’t need to call an external HTTP API**. You can access the DB directly inside your server components or route handlers.

✅ **Benefits:**

- No HTTP latency
    
- Better type safety
    
- Tighter integration with the app
    

---

## ⌛ **2. Simulating Slow Responses for Better UX**

Even though SQLite access is **synchronous**, the dev added an artificial delay using:

```js
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
```

Why? To simulate real-world latency and show how loading states work in **React Server Components** with Next.js.

---

## 🔁 **3. Async/Await in Server Components**

When using data-fetching functions (like `getAllNews()`, `getNewsItem()`), these return promises. You must:

- Mark the component as `async`
    
- Use `await` with the function
    

✅ **This works in server components only** (i.e., no `use client` directive at the top).

---

## 🌀 **4. Adding `loading.js` for Route-Level Feedback**

Next.js makes it **super easy** to show loading states via a sibling file:

### File structure

```
/app/news/
  ├─ page.js
  ├─ loading.js
```

If you have a nested route like `/news/[slug]`, the **parent's `loading.js`** will apply — unless you override it by placing a new `loading.js` inside the `[slug]` folder.

### Example:

```jsx
// news/loading.js
export default function Loading() {
  return <p>Loading news...</p>;
}
```

🧠 **Tip:** Use this for spinners, skeletons, or even progressive UI elements.

---

## 🧩 **5. Nested and Parallel Routes – Handling Client Needs Smartly**

Some components **must** be client-side (e.g. ones using `useRouter`). Example: A modal’s backdrop that closes on click.

### Problem:

You can't use `async` inside a client component.

### Solution:

Split the logic:

- Extract **client-only behavior** (like `useRouter`) into a **small reusable component**
    
- Keep the parent page a **server component**
    

✅ Cleaner structure  
✅ Enables `await` data fetching in the parent

---

## 🧱 **6. Fixing “No Default Component for Parallel Route” Error**

When using **parallel routes** (like intercepting modals with `@modal` folder), make sure to:

### Rename `page.js` to `default.js`

In folders like `app/news/@modal`, use:

```bash
default.js // not page.js
```

Else, Next.js will throw this runtime error.

---

## 🧹 **7. Migration Cleanup**

The dummy data file (`dummy-news.js`) is removed, and all components now rely on the **real DB**.

All related components (detail page, archive filters, image modal) now:

- Use the new DB functions (`getNewsItem`, `getLatestNews`, etc.)
    
- Handle async/await properly
    
- Show loading UIs with `loading.js`
    

---

## 🛠️ **8. Fixing Data Type Bugs**

When checking filters (e.g., year and month), the code previously used:

```js
if (!availableYears.includes(+selectedYear))
```

But now that the DB returns **strings**, the `+` conversion breaks the logic.

### Fix:

Just remove the `+`:

```js
if (!availableYears.includes(selectedYear))
```

Always match types when using `.includes()`!

---

## 🚦 **9. Improving UX in Filter Interactions**

Currently, when clicking on filters (like year/month), the UI **lags silently** before showing data. No feedback = bad UX.

➡️ **Solution (not implemented yet):**

- Add a **loading UI** in nested layouts or specific filter pages
    
- Consider transitioning filter links via a **client-side component** (maybe even `useTransition` or `startTransition` for smoother interactions)
