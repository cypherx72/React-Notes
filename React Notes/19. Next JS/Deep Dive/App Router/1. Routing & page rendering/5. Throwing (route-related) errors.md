## 📄 Page: `page.js` – Handling Invalid Route Segments

### 🧩 Context

- You're using **catch-all routes** in Next.js (e.g. `[...slug].js`) to capture dynamic segments like `/news/2024/03`.
    
- When invalid or excessive segments are entered, **fallback content** appears.
    
- That fallback behavior is **not necessarily wrong**, but not always ideal either.
    

---

### ❌ Problem

- When **invalid segments** are entered (e.g. wrong year/month or too many segments), the fallback renders.
    
- However, you might prefer to show a **custom error message** or redirect instead of fallback content.
    

---

### ✅ Solution: Throwing Errors for Invalid Filters

Add a guard clause in your `page.js` to detect and throw an error when:

1. The selected year is not in the list of available years.
    
2. The selected month is not in the list of months for that year.
    

---

### 📌 Code Logic Summary

#### 💡 Step 1: Add an `if` check before rendering JSX:

```js
if (
  selectedYear &&
  !getAvailableNewsYears().includes(+selectedYear) || // Ensure number type
  (selectedMonth &&
    !getAvailableNewsMonths(+selectedYear).includes(+selectedMonth))
) {
  throw new Error("Invalid filter");
}
```

#### 🧠 Notes:

- `selectedYear` and `selectedMonth` come from dynamic route segments (i.e. `params.slug`).
    
- They are **strings by default**, but `getAvailableNewsYears()` and `getAvailableNewsMonths(year)` return **numbers**.
    
- So we convert the values using `+selectedYear` and `+selectedMonth` for type matching.
    

---

### 📎 Why `includes` Could Fail Without Type Conversion

- `includes("2024") !== includes(2024)`
    
- Always convert string segments to `number` using the `+` prefix when checking against arrays of numbers.
    

---

### 🧪 Examples

|Input Path|Behavior|
|---|---|
|`/news/2023`|✅ Valid, renders normally|
|`/news/2023/05`|✅ Valid, renders normally|
|`/news/2023/99`|❌ Invalid month → throws error|
|`/news/9999/05`|❌ Invalid year → throws error|
|`/news/2023/05/extra`|❌ Too many segments → throws|
|`/news/banana`|❌ Invalid year string → throws|

### 🛑 Default Next.js Error Overlay

- If you throw an error in dev mode, you'll see **Next.js’s red error overlay**.
    
- That’s expected in dev, but in production you want to **gracefully catch it** and show a custom error page.
    

---

## 🛠️ Next Step: Add Custom Error Handling

To handle these errors gracefully:

1. Use an **error boundary** or catch logic in Next.js.
    
2. You can create a special component like `error.js` or use the **`error.js` file inside app router segments** (if using App Router).
    

---

### 📁 For App Router:

```txt
/app/news/[...slug]/error.js
```

This page will render if your `page.js` throws an error.

---

### 2. Convert dynamic route values to numbers using `+`:

- `+selectedYear`, `+selectedMonth`
    
- Prevents mismatch when comparing strings to number arrays.
    

## 🚨 Error Handling

- In dev: shows default red error overlay.
    
- In prod: should redirect or show custom error page.
    

## 🛠️ Optional Enhancement

- Add `/app/news/[...slug]/error.js` (App Router) or use error boundaries (Pages Router) to catch errors gracefully.
    

## 🧪 Test Cases

|Path|Result|
|---|---|
|`/news/2024/03`|✅ Success|
|`/news/2024/99`|❌ Invalid month|
|`/news/banana`|❌ Invalid year|
|`/news/2023/05/extra`|❌ Too many POV segments|

## 🧠 Custom Error Handling in Next.js App Router

### 📍 Problem

By default, when an error occurs (e.g., due to invalid route filters), Next.js shows the **development mode overlay**, which:

- Is not user-friendly.
    
- Should ideally be replaced with a custom fallback UI.
    

---

### ✅ Solution: `error.js` File

Next.js App Router allows you to define **custom error UIs** for route segments using a special file: `error.js`.

#### 🔧 Steps:

1. **Create `error.js` next to `page.js`** of the route you want to handle errors for.
    
2. Add a **client component** to render your custom fallback UI.
    

#### 🧩 Example: `error.js`

```jsx
'use client';

export default function FilterError({ error }) {
  return (
    <div id="error">
      <h2>An error occurred!</h2>
      <p>{error?.message || 'Invalid path'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 🔍 Why `"use client"`?

- The component **must be a client component** to ensure that it:
    
    - Works both on the server and **after hydration on the client**.
        
    - Can react to client-side issues (e.g., user-triggered state changes or interactions).
        

---

### 🛠️ Notes:

- `error.js` is **similar to** `not-found.js` — it **overrides errors locally** within its route segment.
    
- Errors thrown in `page.js` (e.g., from invalid filters) will automatically be caught by this file.
    
- The `error` object passed into `FilterError` contains the actual error message (`error.message`) which can be displayed for more specific feedback.
