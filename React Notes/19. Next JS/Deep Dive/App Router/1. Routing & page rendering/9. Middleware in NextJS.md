### üß† **Core Concept: Middleware in Next.js**

---

### üìù **What‚Äôs the feature about?**

**Middleware** in Next.js allows you to execute code before the actual handling of a request. It‚Äôs a powerful feature for running custom logic such as authentication checks, request modification, or logging, before the request is forwarded to its destination (like a page or API route).

---

### üîë **Why is this useful?**

- **Request Preprocessing**: Middleware provides an opportunity to inspect and modify incoming requests before they are processed by pages or API routes.
    
- **Authentication & Authorization**: You can use middleware to **block unauthorized requests** or **redirect users** based on specific conditions, like login status.
    
- **Global Logic**: It runs for every request across the application, making it ideal for tasks that should be applied globally (e.g., checking cookies or headers).

### üìå **How is it set up?**

1. **Create `middleware.js`**:
    
    - Add a file called `middleware.js` at the root of your project (same level as `package.json`).
        
2. **Export `middleware` Function**:
    
    - This function receives the `request` object and must return a **Next response**.
        
    
    Example:
    
    ```js
    // middleware.js
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
    
    export function middleware(req) {
      // Custom logic goes here
      return NextResponse.next(); // Continue the request
    }
    ```
    
3. **Modifying the Request**:
    
    - Inside `middleware`, you can inspect or modify the incoming `request` object.
        
    - You can also block the request or redirect it based on your conditions.
        
    
    Example of redirecting if the user is not authenticated:
    
    ```js
    if (!userAuthenticated) {
      return NextResponse.redirect('/login');
    }
    ```
    
4. **Add a `config` Object**:
    
    - Optionally, export a `config` object to **filter** requests that should trigger the middleware.
        
    - This allows you to define which routes should activate the middleware, e.g., `/news`.
        
    
    Example:
    
    ```js
    export const config = {
      matcher: ['/news'],  // Only triggers on /news route
    };
    ```

### ‚ö° **Why should you care?**

- **Global Request Control**: Middleware gives you the ability to control what happens with every request in your app. This is essential for **authentication**, **logging**, **caching**, and other operations that should happen before the main logic.
    
- **Flexible Routing**: You can **filter middleware** based on specific routes or conditions (e.g., only for `/news`), offering great flexibility to run logic on targeted pages or APIs.
    

---

### üîÑ **TL;DR**

- **Middleware** = Custom logic before requests hit pages or API routes.
    
- You can **inspect**, **modify**, or **block** requests globally.
    
- Useful for tasks like **authentication**, **logging**, and **request filtering**.
    
- Use the **`matcher` config** to filter middleware triggers.
