## 🔁 Recapping Server vs. Client Components

### 🔹 Key Takeaways

- **Server Components**:
    
    - Default in Next.js.
        
    - Run only on the server (no JS sent to the client for these components).
        
    - Console logs in them will show only in the server terminal.
        
    - Ideal for performance — don’t send unnecessary JS to the browser.
        
- **Client Components**:
    
    - Require `use client` directive at the top.
        
    - Necessary when using browser-only hooks like `usePathname`, `useEffect`, etc.
        
    - Can be pre-rendered server-side but also execute in the browser afterward.
        
    - Convert only **minimal portions** of code to client components to avoid bloating your frontend bundle.
        

### 🔹 Strategy

When you **need a client-only feature** like highlighting the active nav link:

- **Isolate** that into a small, reusable client component.
    
- Leave the parent (e.g., `MainHeader`) as a server component.
    

This practice helps **keep the app fast** and leverages the best of both rendering strategies.

## 🧭 Routing Deep Dive — Interceptor Routes (Setup Phase)

Before jumping into intercepting routes, the instructor sets up the scenario using **nested dynamic routes**:

### 🎯 Goal

When the user clicks a **news item image**, they’re taken to a **full-screen view of that image** on a separate route:

```
/news/[slug]/image
```

### 📂 Folder Structure

To create this route:

```
/app
  └── news
       └── [slug]
            └── image
                 └── page.js
```

### ✅ What Was Done

1. Created a new route under `[slug]/image/page.js`.
    
2. Extracted `params.slug` to identify the news article.
    
3. Looked up the news item using the slug.
    
4. Displayed the image in a `fullscreen-image` styled div.
    
5. Linked to this route using a `<Link>` inside `[slug]/page.js`.
    

### 🔍 This is **not** yet an intercepting route.

It's just a nested route, rendered like any other page when navigated to.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

You’re being prepped to appreciate the **difference** between:

- **Standard nested routing** (what we just implemented),
    
- Versus **Intercepting routes**, which go further by overlaying content **without fully leaving the current page**.
    

This becomes crucial when you want UX like:

- Lightbox-style modals
    
- Slide-in panels
    
- Quick previews without full page reloads
    

---

## 💡 What's Coming Next: Intercepting Routes

This is where Next.js’ App Router shines — you’ll soon see how to **intercept navigation** and show routes as overlays, modals, or side panels, all while:

- Keeping the original page in the background,
    
- Not triggering a full route change (unless needed),
    
- Maintaining better **performance** and **UX**.
    

---

### 🛠️ TL;DR Developer Tips So Far

- Default to server components.
    
- Only switch to client components when **absolutely required**.
    
- Modularize client-side logic — keep it lean.
    
- Nested routes inside dynamic folders work exactly as expected.
    
- Intercepting routes (up next) will help you build fluid, modern UIs without navigating away.
    


---

## 🔍 What is an Intercepting Route?

### 🧠 Concept:

An **intercepting route** in Next.js is a special type of route that **overrides** the default rendering behavior **when navigation is internal (client-side)** — like clicking a `<Link>`. But when you:

- Refresh the page,
    
- Manually enter the URL,
    
- Or come from an external link...
    

...then the **original route** gets rendered instead.

This allows you to render:

- A **modal** or **lightbox** on top of the current page during internal navigation
    
- A **full page** when the same URL is visited externally
    

> 🔄 Same URL, different behavior — based on _how_ the user got there.

---

## 📦 Use Case: Full-Screen Image vs Modal Image

Let’s say you have a news site. You want:

- Clicking an image to **open a modal** (intercepted view)
    
- But navigating directly to the image URL to show a **full page**
    

---

## 📁 How to Set Up an Intercepting Route

### 🎯 You already have this structure:

```
/app/news/[slug]/image/page.js   ← Full-page route
```

### 🧱 To intercept it, create a sibling route like this:

```
/app/news/[slug]/(.)image/page.js
```

### 🧾 Explanation of `(.)image`:

- `.` inside the parentheses means "same level" (like `./` in imports).
    
- `image` is the name of the route you are **intercepting**.
    
- Together: `(.)image` means: intercept the `image` route that is **in the same folder**.
    

> 💡 If it were in a parent folder, you’d write `(..)image`, and so on.

---

## 🧪 Result

- If you **navigate to `/news/abc/image` via `<Link>`** from `/news/abc`, you'll see the **intercepted route** in `(.)image/page.js`. This could render a modal or overlay.
    
- If you **refresh the page** or paste that URL in the browser, it falls back to the **default route** at `image/page.js`, showing the full-screen version.
    

---

## 🔧 Code Demo (Basic Example)

**Intercepted route: `/news/[slug]/(.)image/page.js`**

```jsx
// /app/news/[slug]/(.)image/page.js
export default function InterceptedImagePage({ params }) {
  const newsItem = DUMMY_NEWS.find(item => item.slug === params.slug);
  if (!newsItem) notFound();

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Intercepted</h2>
      <div className="fullscreen-image">
        <img src={`/images/news/${newsItem.image}`} alt={newsItem.title} />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Full route: `/news/[slug]/image/page.js`**

```jsx
// /app/news/[slug]/image/page.js
export default function ImagePage({ params }) {
  const newsItem = DUMMY_NEWS.find(item => item.slug === params.slug);
  if (!newsItem) notFound();

  return (
    <div className="fullscreen-image">
      <img src={`/images/news/${newsItem.image}`} alt={newsItem.title} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## 🔍 Verification Steps

1. Click the image link → You see `Intercepted` above the image.
    
2. Refresh the page → The "Intercepted" text disappears. You're now seeing the full route.
    

---

## 🧠 Why Use Intercepting Routes?

- **Improves UX**: Show modals, drawers, or previews without full page transitions.
    
- **Preserves URLs**: The browser URL matches the content, so deep linking/sharing still works.
    
- **Code Separation**: Different components (modal vs page) for same route = better logic separation.
    

---

## 🧭 Next Up: Intercepting Routes + Parallel Routes

This is where things get really slick — you’ll use **parallel routes** to show:

- The **modal content** in a specific layout slot (like a `@modal` slot),
    
- While keeping the original page (background content) visible underneath.
    

---

## 🔍 **Concept Summary**

### 🚦 Intercepting Routes

An **intercepting route** is a special type of route in Next.js (App Router) that overrides the default route behavior **only during internal navigation** (e.g. clicking a link). If the user **reloads the page** or accesses it directly, the regular route loads instead.

This allows you to:

- Show a **modal** when a user clicks on something (internal navigation).
    
- Show a **full screen page** when a user visits the URL directly or reloads.
    

---

## 🧠 **How It Works: Step-by-Step**

### 1. **Intercept Route Folder Naming**

Create a folder:

```
(./image)
```

- Parentheses (`()`) = an intercepting route.
    
- Inside the parentheses = **relative path** (just like `import` paths).
    
    - `.` means same folder
        
    - `..` means go up one level
        
- The name **after** the parentheses = path segment being intercepted.
    

Example:

```
news/[slug]/(./image)/page.js
```

Intercepts internal navigation to `/news/[slug]/image`.

---

### 2. **Create Modal UI**

In the intercepting `page.js`:

```jsx
<>
  <div className="modal-backdrop" />
  <dialog className="modal" open>
    {/* Modal Content */}
  </dialog>
</>
```

Now, when navigating internally (via `<Link>`), the modal shows.  
If the page is reloaded directly, you still get the full-screen version.

---

### 3. **Enable Parallel Routes**

To overlay modal **on top of** the current page, use **parallel routing**.

Structure:

```
news/[slug]/
  layout.js
  page.js (regular detail page)
  @modal/
    (./image)/page.js (modal)
    default.js (returns null)
```

In `layout.js`:

```jsx
export default function NewsDetailLayout({ children, modal }) {
  return (
    <>
      {modal}
      {children}
    </>
  )
}
```

- `children` = detail page
    
- `modal` = intercepted modal (if active)
    

> ✅ **Important**: Parallel route folders like `@modal` are _not reflected in the URL_. They're ignored in the route path logic but important in the **file structure**.

---

### 4. **Add a Default Fallback for Modal**

To prevent errors when there's no active modal:

```jsx
// news/[slug]/@modal/default.js
export default function ModalDefaultPage() {
  return null;
}
```

This ensures that `/news/[slug]` loads without issues even if no modal is open.

---

## ✅ **Result**

- When clicking on an image inside a news detail page → modal opens **on top** of the existing content.
    
- When reloading the URL `/news/[slug]/image` directly → full page loads instead of modal.
    

---

## 📌 When to Use This

Use this pattern when you need:

- **Context-aware navigation** (modal vs full page)
    
- **Non-disruptive UI** (modals that overlay without full page reload)
    
- **Better user experience** in image galleries, video previews, product modals, etc.
    

---

## 🚀 Pro Tip

- Combine with `useRouter()` and `router.back()` to handle modal close buttons.
    
- Use a portal if needed to render modal outside the normal DOM tree for better styling.
    


---

## ✅ **Replace `page.js` with `default.js` in `@modal`**

When using **parallel routes** like `@modal`, Next.js treats the file structure differently:

### 🔄 **The Problem**

If you leave a `page.js` inside `news/[slug]/@modal/`, and you try to access:

```
/news/<slug>/image
```

via **direct navigation** (e.g., browser reload), you’ll often get a **404 or internal error**, because Next.js is expecting a **default entry point** in that parallel route.

---

### ✅ **The Fix**

Rename:

```
news/[slug]/@modal/page.js
➡️
news/[slug]/@modal/default.js
```

This makes it the **default child** for the `@modal` slot when rendering in parallel with the primary route (`page.js` inside `news/[slug]/`).

---

### 🔍 What’s Actually Happening

- `@modal/default.js`: This file gets rendered when the modal slot is active (e.g., the user clicks an image).
    
- `@modal/(intercepted)/page.js`: Handles intercepted modal route (`/image`) only on internal navigation.
    
- If `@modal/page.js` exists but doesn't match the intercepted path, the slot has **no valid component**, and Next.js throws.
    

By renaming to `default.js`, you explicitly define the modal content (or `null`) for any matching route.

---

### ✅ Final Structure Recap

```
news/
└── [slug]/
    ├── page.js                  ← Article detail page
    ├── layout.js                ← Hosts both children and modal
    └── @modal/
        ├── (image)/page.js      ← Intercepted modal page
        └── default.js           ← Renders modal if matched (or null)
```

In `layout.js`:

```tsx
export default function NewsDetailLayout({ children, modal }) {
  return (
    <>
      {modal}
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
```

---

## 🔄 TL;DR

**Do this:**  
✅ Rename `@modal/page.js` → `@modal/default.js`  
✅ Ensure `(image)/page.js` exists for modal overlay  
✅ Return `null` in `default.js` if nothing to render

This ensures:

- Smooth internal navigation (modal overlay)
    
- Safe direct navigation or reloads (full page or nothing rendered cleanly)
    

---

### Navigating Programmatically - Parallel & Intercepted routes 

---

## ✅ Goal

Clicking the **modal backdrop** should:

- Trigger a navigation event
    
- Close the modal
    
- Take the user **back to the detail page** they came from
    
- Without manually clicking the browser’s back button
    

---

## 🧠 Solution: Use `useRouter().back()` from `next/navigation`

### ✅ Step-by-step:

### 1. Add `"use client"` to the modal file (intercepted route page)

This is **required** because `useRouter()` is a **client-side hook**.

```tsx
"use client";
```

### 2. Import `useRouter` from the correct source

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
```

> ❌ Not from `next/router` — that’s for the **Pages Router**, not App Router.

---

### 3. Set up the backdrop click behavior

Assuming your modal layout looks like this:

```tsx
export default function ImageModalPage() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <div
      className="modal-backdrop"
      onClick={() => router.back()}
    >
      <dialog open className="modal" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>
        <img src="..." alt="..." />
      </dialog>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> 🛑 **Important:** Add `e.stopPropagation()` to the `<dialog>` `onClick`, so that clicking inside the modal doesn't bubble up and trigger a backdrop close.

---

## 🧪 Test Behavior

### ✅ Works as expected when:

- You **navigate to a detail page** (`/news/some-slug`)
    
- Then click an image which triggers the modal overlay (`/news/some-slug/image`)
    
- Clicking the **backdrop** will now call `router.back()` and return to `/news/some-slug`
    

### ⚠️ On direct navigation or refresh to `/news/some-slug/image`:

The modal becomes **full screen**, and clicking the backdrop still navigates “back” — often to `/news/some-slug` if browser history supports it, or to previous page if not.

---

## 🧩 Bonus Tip (Optional UX Enhancements)

- You can also use `Escape` key to close the modal with a keyboard listener.
    
- Animate modal opening/closing with `framer-motion` or CSS transitions.
    
- Add `aria-modal`, `role="dialog"` for accessibility.

## ✅ Summary

|Task|Code / API|
|---|---|
|Programmatic navigation|`useRouter()` from `next/navigation`|
|Go back to previous page|`router.back()`|
|Only in client components|Use `"use client"` directive|
|Prevent click bubbling|`e.stopPropagation()` on modal itself|
