## üß† Concept: **How Next.js Optimizes Images**

### ‚úÖ Why use the `<Image>` component from `next/image`?

The default HTML `<img>` tag:

- Does **not** optimize image loading.
    
- Can cause layout shifts.
    
- Loads images even if they‚Äôre off-screen.
    

Next.js `<Image>` advantages:

- **Automatic resizing** and **serving optimal formats** (e.g., WebP).
    
- **Lazy loading** (loads only when visible).
    
- **Prevents layout shifts** by knowing image dimensions ahead of time.
    
- Improves **page speed and visual stability**.

## üß∞ Step-by-Step: Optimizing a Static (Local) Image

### üñºÔ∏è Case: Optimizing a **static logo** in the header

### Context:

- Logo image is **stored locally** in the project.
    
- It's displayed in `header.js` using the standard `<img>` tag.
    
- You know its dimensions (important for stability and performance).
    

### üîÅ Your Task:

Replace the standard `<img>` tag with the optimized `<Image>` component from `next/image`.

---

## ‚úÖ How To Use the Next.js `<Image />` Component

### Step 1: **Import the Component**

```js
import Image from 'next/image';
```

### Step 2: **Import the Image File**

```js
import logoImage from '../public/logo.png'; // adjust path as needed
```

### Step 3: **Replace the `<img>` with `<Image>`**

```jsx
<Image
  src={logoImage}
  alt="Site Logo"
/>
```

### Note:

- For **locally stored images**, Next.js **automatically infers** the width and height.
    
- But it‚Äôs often best practice to **manually provide `width` and `height`** to prevent layout shifts and give more control:
    

```jsx
<Image
  src={logoImage}
  alt="Site Logo"
  width={150}
  height={50}
/>
```

---

## üß± Gotcha: You'll See an Error If...

You just replace `<img>` with `<Image>` and pass a string path like:

```jsx
<Image src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This causes an error **unless** you do **one** of the following:

1. Import it directly (as shown above)
    
2. Explicitly define width and height when using a path string:
    

```jsx
<Image
  src="/logo.png"
  alt="Logo"
  width={150}
  height={50}
/>
```

## üöß What‚Äôs Next?

In the following parts of this section, the course will likely address:

- Optimizing **dynamic images from Cloudinary**
    
- Handling **external image domains**
    
- Exploring more `<Image>` options (like `placeholder="blur"`)
    

---

## üñºÔ∏è Importing a Local Image in Next.js

- When you write:
    
    ```js
    import logo from '../public/logo.png';
    ```
    
    Next.js transforms that import into an **object**, not just a string path.
    
- **Example object structure** (logged at runtime):
    
    ```js
    {
      src: "/_next/image?url=%2Flogo.png&w=640&q=75",
      height: 200,
      width: 600,
      blurDataURL: "data:image/‚Ä¶",    // if using placeholders
      blurWidth: 8,
      blurHeight: 3
    }
    ```
    

---

## üîÑ Why You Must Pass the Whole Object to `<Image>`

- **Wrong** (this causes an error):
    
    ```jsx
    <Image src={logo.src} alt="Logo" />
    ```
    
- **Right**:
    
    ```jsx
    <Image src={logo} alt="Logo" />
    ```
    
- **Reason:**  
    The `<Image>` component reads `.width` and `.height` from the object to:
    
    1. **Reserve layout space** (avoiding content shift).
        
    2. **Generate a `srcset`** with multiple device‚Äëpixel sizes.
        
    3. Enable placeholder or blur support.
        

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Next.js Does Under the Hood

1. **Renders a native `<img>`**, but with extra attributes:
    
    - `width` & `height` (from the import object).
        
    - `loading="lazy"` by default.
        
    - A `srcset` attribute pointing to automatically resized variants.
        
2. **Automatic format selection** (e.g. WebP) when supported.
    
3. **Responsive sizing** via multiple URLs in `srcset`:
    
    ```html
    srcset="
      /_next/image?url=%2Flogo.png&w=640 640w,
      /_next/image?url=%2Flogo.png&w=828 828w,
      ‚Ä¶
    "
    ```
    

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways

- **Always pass the imported image object** (`logo`), not `logo.src`.
    
- Next.js needs the object‚Äôs **width** & **height** for layout stability.
    
- The component **automatically** handles:
    
    - **Lazy loading**
        
    - **Responsive sizes** (`srcset`)
        
    - **Optimal formats** (WebP, AVIF)
        
- You **can override** `width`/`height` manually if needed, but the defaults come from the import.
    

---

That change‚Äîfrom `<img src={logo.src}>` to `<Image src={logo}>`‚Äîis the essential tweak to unlock Next.js‚Äôs powerful, built‚Äëin image optimizations.

---

### ‚úÖ **What‚Äôs Going On**

Max is explaining how **Next.js's `<Image />` component** works with **imported local images**, how it **differs from the native `<img />`**, and how to **properly manage image sizing** for performance and visual stability.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake

When using `<img src={logo.src} />`, you're assuming the imported file is just a string path.

But in **Next.js**, when you do:

```js
import logo from '../public/logo.png';
```

You're not importing a path ‚Äî you're importing an **object** like:

```js
{
  src: '/_next/static/media/logo.abc123.png',
  height: 120,
  width: 200,
  blurDataURL: '...',
  ...
}
```

So for `<Image />`, **don't do this**:

```jsx
<Image src={logo.src} />
```

‚ùå This will break or not fully leverage Next.js image optimization.

Instead, **do this**:

```jsx
<Image src={logo} />
```

‚úÖ This passes the entire image metadata object to the Next.js Image component.

---

### üîç Why This Matters

1. **Image Optimization**: Next.js needs full access to the image‚Äôs width, height, and metadata to generate multiple sizes and serve the most appropriate one depending on the device (via `srcset`).
    
2. **Avoid Layout Shift**: By knowing the actual dimensions, Next.js prevents elements from "jumping around" while the image loads.
    
3. **Responsive Behavior**:
    
    - Next.js automatically creates different versions of the image for different screen densities (via `srcset`).
        
    - This reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up load time.
        

---

### üõ† Controlling the Image Size

You have **three options** to control the size of an image:

---

#### 1. **Let Next.js Use the Original Size** (Default, Recommended for Static Images)

```jsx
<Image src={logo} />
```

Let it use the image‚Äôs actual width and height.

---

#### 2. **Manually Set `width` and `height` Props** (Quick and Dirty)

```jsx
<Image src={logo} width={100} height={100} />
```

- ‚úÖ Forces a specific display size.
    
- ‚úÖ Next.js will generate optimized images to fit that size.
    
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not ideal for responsiveness.
    

---

#### 3. **Use the `sizes` Prop** (Responsive, Recommended)

```jsx
<Image
  src={logo}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 50vw, 100px"
/>
```

This tells the browser how big the image will be on different screens. For example:

- `50vw` for small screens,
    
- Fixed `100px` for large screens.
    

Next.js then serves the smallest possible image for that screen.

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practices Summary

|Scenario|Recommended Approach|
|---|---|
|Static image, no responsiveness|Use `<Image src={logo} />`|
|Need fixed dimensions|Use `width` and `height` props|
|Need responsiveness|Use `sizes` prop with `%`, `vw`, `media queries`|
|Image is unnecessarily large|Resize it **before importing** (in Photoshop, etc.)|

Here's a clear and actionable breakdown of what Maximilian is explaining regarding **Next.js `<Image />` component and lazy loading vs. priority loading**:

---

## üß† Key Concept: **Lazy Loading by Default**

By default, **Next.js sets the `loading="lazy"`** attribute on all images rendered with `<Image />`. This means:

- The browser **won‚Äôt load the image until it's close to being visible** in the viewport.
    
- ‚úÖ This is great for performance **on scroll-heavy pages** or when the image is **below the fold**.
    
- ‚ùå But **it‚Äôs wasteful for images that are _always visible when the page loads_** ‚Äî e.g. a **logo in the header** or **hero banner**.
    

---

## üî• When You Know the Image is Immediately Visible

If an image **will always be on screen when the page first loads**, like:

- Site logos
    
- Navigation icons
    
- Hero section background images
    
- Static profile picture in the top nav
    

Then **lazy loading is pointless**.

> It actually **adds unnecessary work** for the browser because it has to check whether or not to load it, even though we know it always needs to be shown.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Use the `priority` Prop

Add the `priority` prop to tell Next.js:

> ‚ÄúThis image is essential and should be loaded as early as possible.‚Äù

Example:

```jsx
<Image
  src={logo}
  alt="My App Logo"
  width={120}
  height={120}
  priority
/>
```

---

### What This Does:

- Disables `loading="lazy"`.
    
- Adds `fetchpriority="high"` under the hood.
    
- Ensures **preloading** of the image during HTML parsing for faster LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).
    

---

## üîé Before vs After

|Scenario|Result|
|---|---|
|No `priority`|`loading="lazy"`|
|With `priority`|`fetchpriority="high"`, no lazy load|

---

## üí° When _Not_ to Use `priority`

Don‚Äôt use it for:

- Images that are **below the fold**
    
- Images that **might not appear** on initial load (e.g. modals, tabs, carousels off-screen)
    
- Dynamic content rendered conditionally
    

Overusing `priority` can **negatively impact performance** by front-loading too much.

---

## üîó Further Optimizations

- Use [Next.js's Image Optimization Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#priority) to fine-tune based on your layout strategy.
    
- Combine `priority` with a well-set `sizes` prop and properly sized input images.
    

---

## üîö Coming Next‚Ä¶

Max hints that he's about to discuss:

> **Dynamically added images** (e.g., user-uploaded or runtime-fetched content).

These require a **different approach** because they **don‚Äôt exist during build time**, so they can't be optimized statically. You‚Äôll likely need to:

- Use `loader` props
    
- Configure remote patterns
    
- Handle unknown dimensions
