## "use server" Does Not Guarantee Server-side Execution!

### Key Concept

In Next.js, the `use server` directive is used to define Server Actions, but **it does not guarantee that the code will exclusively execute on the server-side**. This is an important distinction that can impact how you manage your code, particularly when it comes to sensitive information or logic you want to ensure does not reach the client.

### What Does "use server" Do?

The `use server` directive simply signals to Next.js that the function it’s applied to should be treated as a **Server Action**. This means that Next.js will handle requests to this function on the server-side. It doesn’t mean that the function will **only** run on the server-side, though.

- **Server Actions**: When you mark a function with `use server`, Next.js makes a request to that function from the client, but the actual execution is on the server.
    
- **Client-Side Availability**: Despite being marked with `use server`, the function's code **can still be sent to the client** in certain cases. This could be problematic if you're handling sensitive data or performing operations you want to keep secure on the server.
    

### Why `use server` Doesn't Guarantee Server-Side Execution

- **Client-Side Bundling**: Next.js builds its bundles in such a way that functions are not strictly divided into server-only or client-only. This means that even if you define something as a Server Action, its logic might still be included in the client-side JavaScript bundle in some circumstances.
    
- **Invisible Server Request**: While `use server` triggers server-side logic when invoked, it does not **hide** the code itself from the client. In some cases, developers assume that this will automatically prevent any code from being accessible on the client-side, but that assumption is incorrect.
    

### Best Practice for Server-Only Code

If you have code that **must never** run or be accessible on the client-side—whether it's sensitive data handling, authentication logic, or any critical functionality—you should **not** rely solely on `use server`. Instead, use **server-only packages** to ensure that certain code is kept entirely on the server-side, away from any client-side access.

#### Example of Using a Server-Only Package

You can use a server-only package in Next.js, like `next-auth` or any package designed specifically for server-side operations, to handle server-only logic.

```js
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth/next';

export const serverOnlyAction = async () => {
  const session = await getServerSession(req, res);
  // Your server-only logic here
};
```

This ensures that **no client-side code** will have access to the function, preserving the security of sensitive operations.

### Conclusion

While `use server` is helpful for defining Server Actions, **it does not protect against exposing sensitive server-side code to the client**. For guaranteed server-only execution, always use appropriate server-only packages or mechanisms. Don't rely solely on `use server` for securing code.
