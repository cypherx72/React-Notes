In this section, we walk through how to implement a like button for posts in a Next.js application, trigger server-side actions, and update the database. The goal is to provide a smooth interaction where users can like or unlike a post, and the UI reflects the changes. Here's how we can achieve this:


1. **Database Setup**: The user has a `likes` table to store the relationship between users and posts. This table stores a combination of `user ID` and `post ID` to track which user has liked which post.
    
2. **Database Query**: In the code, there's a query that checks if a specific user has liked a post (by checking the `likes` table). This query is hardcoded for user ID `2`, as there's no user authentication in this tutorial yet.
    
3. **Post Retrieval Logic**: When retrieving posts from the database, an `IsLiked` property is added to each post, which indicates whether the current user (user ID `2`) has liked the post.
    
4. **Like/Unlike Action**: The action to toggle the like status of a post (`updatePostLikeStatus`) either inserts or deletes a like entry in the `likes` table based on the user's previous interaction. This is invoked via a button click.
    
5. **Server Action**: The tutorial introduces a Server Action to handle the database update when the like button is clicked. This action is created in the `actions` folder and calls the `updatePostLikeStatus` function, passing the post ID as an argument.
    
6. **Button and Form Setup**: The like button is wrapped in a form, and the Server Action (`togglePostLikeStatus`) is triggered when the form is submitted. The post ID is passed to the Server Action using the `bind()` method to ensure the correct data is submitted.
    
7. **Conditional Class Application**: The appearance of the like button is conditionally styled based on whether the post is liked or not. If the post is liked, a `liked` CSS class is applied to the button's parent element.
    
8. **Pre-configuring the Server Action**: The `bind()` method is used to ensure that the `post ID` is passed as the first argument to the `togglePostLikeStatus` Server Action when the form is submitted.
    

### Issues:

- **Instant UI Update**: The page doesnâ€™t immediately reflect the like/unlike change; it requires a reload to show the updated status. This is a common issue when dealing with form submissions and state changes in server-rendered applications.
    

### Solution for Better UX:

To improve the user experience and make the like button update immediately without needing a page reload, you can:

1. **Optimistic UI**: Use an optimistic update strategy where you update the UI immediately on the button press, assuming the action will succeed. Once the server response is received, you can confirm or revert the changes.
    
2. **Client-Side State**: Implement client-side state (e.g., using `useState` or `useReducer`) to update the like status on the frontend immediately after the button click. Afterward, send the request to the server to persist the state.
    

**You're looking at improving the **user experience** in a Next.js app when **mutating data on the server**â€”like toggling a "like" on a postâ€”and ensuring that the UI reflects the latest data **without delay or requiring a manual refresh**. Let me break this down practically and forward-think how to optimize it:

---

### âœ… What's Going On:

Now performing a mutation (e.g. `togglePostLikeStatus`) inside a **Server Action**. The DB updates, but due to **Next.js caching**, the UI doesnâ€™t immediately reflect the change unless you explicitly **revalidate the path** using:

```ts
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';

revalidatePath('/feed'); // or '/' with scope
```

### ðŸ”¥ Why This Matters:

- Next.js caches data **by default** to improve performance.
    
- **Without `revalidatePath()`**, the UI continues to serve outdated static content.
    
- With it, **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** is triggeredâ€”so data is fetched fresh again.
    

---

### ðŸ§  Improvement 1: Use `revalidatePath()` correctly

#### âœ… Specific path:

```ts
revalidatePath('/feed');
```

This is scoped to only one route.

#### ðŸ”„ Global revalidation:

```ts
revalidatePath('/', 'layout');
```

This will revalidate all pages under the root layoutâ€”basically your entire app.

> Use this when the changed data may affect multiple routes.

---

### ðŸ§  Improvement 2: Optimistic UI Updates (To remove the delay)

Even with `revalidatePath()`, there's a **lag** until the new data is shown. Thatâ€™s where **optimistic updates** shine.

#### Example Strategy (Client-side optimistic state update):

```tsx
const likePost = async () => {
  // Immediately update the UI
  setLiked(true);

  try {
    await togglePostLikeStatus(postId); // server action
  } catch (error) {
    // Revert UI if server fails
    setLiked(false);
  }
};
```

You're **assuming** success and rendering the updated state immediately, rolling back if the request fails. This makes the app feel faster.

---

### ðŸ§  Improvement 3: Use SWR or TanStack Query (if you're using client fetching)

If you fetch data on the client side with TanStack Query, revalidating and syncing UI is even easier:

```ts
const queryClient = useQueryClient();
await togglePostLikeStatus(id);
queryClient.invalidateQueries(['posts']); // or a specific post query
```

---

### ðŸ§  Summary: Final Strategy

|Step|Tool/Method|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Mutate data on the server|`await togglePostLikeStatus()`|Executes the DB update|
|Revalidate updated pages|`revalidatePath()`|Refresh cache to reflect changes|
|Improve perceived speed|**Optimistic UI update**|Makes UX feel instant|
|Broader cache control (optional)|`'layout'` scope in `revalidatePath()`|Revalidate all affected routes|
