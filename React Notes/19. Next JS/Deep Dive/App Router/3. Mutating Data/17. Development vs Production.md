An important **gotcha in production** when working with **Next.js**, especially when using **Static Site Generation (SSG)** or **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** and **Server Actions**. Here's a direct breakdown of what’s happening, what went wrong, and how to fix it properly:

---

### ⚠️ Problem Encountered in Production

In development mode, everything works fine:

- You can **create** and **see new posts** instantly.
    
- Updates reflect because of **dev-mode auto re-rendering**.
    

However, in **production mode**, after running:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

you’ll notice:

- Newly created posts **don’t appear immediately** after creation.
    
- Reloading the page doesn’t help.
    
- Data feels stale and cached.

### 🔍 Why This Happens

Next.js uses **Static Site Generation** by default for many routes, especially in `app/` directory (if using App Router), or when using `getStaticProps` in Pages Router.

During `npm run build`:

- Pages are **pre-rendered** and **cached**.
    
- These static pages **don’t update** unless:
    
    - You manually revalidate them, or
        
    - You use **server-side rendering** (`getServerSideProps`) or ISR with a short revalidation time.
        

In the case of this app:

- New posts don’t show because the **feed page is statically generated and cached**.
    
- Liking a post **triggers `revalidatePath()`**, so it _incidentally_ forces the post list to update (a hacky side effect).

### ✅ The Solution: `revalidatePath('/path')` on Data Mutation

When a post is created, call:

```js
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'

revalidatePath('/feed') // Or whatever route shows the posts
```

This tells Next.js:

- “The data for `/feed` has changed. Please discard the cache and re-render it fresh.”
    
- You do this **inside your Server Action** where the post is created.
    

✅ **Best practice:** Revalidate only the paths that are affected. Don’t revalidate everything unless needed.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- **SSG means static** — you must revalidate to update.
    
- In **production**, always remember to:
    
    - Revalidate relevant paths when **mutating data**.
        
    - Understand what is cached and when it’s re-fetched.
        
- You can **preview production mode locally** with:
    
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm start
    ```
