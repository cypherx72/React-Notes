## ðŸ§  **Concept Being Explained:**

### **Storing Form Data Using a Server Action in Next.js (App Router)**

This section of the transcript focuses on:

- Calling a **database function** (e.g., `storePost`) inside a **Server Action**.
    
- Extracting submitted form data.
    
- Using a placeholder (temporary) solution for **file uploads** and **authentication**.
    
- Validating that the data was stored by checking the **rendered feed**.

## âœ… Step-by-Step Breakdown with Context

### 1. **Server Action Receives Form Data**

You previously created a Server Action like:

```ts
'use server';

export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title');
  const content = formData.get('content');
  const image = formData.get('image'); // File, not URL yet

  // Placeholder for now
  const imageUrl = ''; // later will be replaced with real upload logic

  const post = {
    title,
    content,
    image: imageUrl,
    userId: 1, // Hardcoded dummy user
  };

  await storePost(post); // Call DB helper
}
```

---

### 2. **Storing to the Database**

`storePost()` is a backend utility function located in something like `lib/posts.js`.

It probably inserts data into SQLite or Prisma like:

```js
export async function storePost(post) {
  return await db.post.create({
    data: {
      title: post.title,
      content: post.content,
      image: post.image,
      userId: post.userId,
    }
  });
}
```

### 3. **Handling Missing Features**

#### ðŸ”¸ Image Handling

- Right now, youâ€™re only getting a **file** from `<input type="file">`.
    
- Youâ€™re **not uploading** or **converting** that to a URL yet.
    
- So, youâ€™re passing `''` (an empty string) as the image URL.
    

#### ðŸ”¸ Authentication

- No login system is in place yet.
    
- Youâ€™re using a **hardcoded user ID = 1** to simulate the author.
    

This is okay for prototyping. Later, proper **auth + file upload** will be added.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Example Scenario

You open `/new-post`, fill in:

- `Title: Yummy`
    
- `Image: loaded_fries.png`
    
- `Content: Had a great stay...`
    

You hit **Create Post**.

What happens:

1. Form data gets sent to `createPost(formData)`
    
2. `createPost` calls `storePost(post)` with dummy data
    
3. Post gets stored in the DB
    
4. You go to `/feed` â†’ it fetches posts via `getPosts()` â†’ and your new post appears!

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learning Outcomes

|**What You Should Understand**|**Why It Matters**|
|---|---|
|How to extract and pass `FormData` inside a Server Action|Enables seamless form submission on the server|
|How to interface with a backend DB helper like `storePost()`|Allows storing structured data in your database|
|Temporary hacks: image placeholder, userId = 1|Helps prototype fast; refactor later with auth/upload|
|That data is rendered from the DB on the `/feed` page|Proves that server actions and DB writes are working|

## ðŸ›  Whatâ€™s Coming Next

In the next section, the instructor hints at improving UX by:

- Adding **loading indicators**
    
- Hiding buttons while submitting
    
- **Redirecting to the feed** after submission
    
- Implementing **file uploads**
    
- Later: adding **authentication**
    

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

**Concept:** Using Server Actions in Next.js to submit form data directly to a backend and store it in a database  
**Example:** `createPost(formData)` calls `storePost()` with extracted data  
**Takeaway:** You can build real server-powered form logic without APIs or fetch(), and simulate incomplete features with dummy values as placeholders.

### **1. Awaiting the Store Post Operation and Redirecting**

- **Why It's Important:**  
    The first thing you need to ensure is that you're **waiting** for the asynchronous operation (i.e., storing the post) to finish before performing actions like redirecting the user.
    
- **Key Concept:**
    
    - Use `await` on the store post function (`storePost`), which returns a promise.
        
    - **Redirect after awaiting the store post operation** using the `redirect` function from `next/navigation`:
        
        ```js
        await storePost(post);
        redirect('/feed');
        ```
        
- **What You Need to Do:**
    
    - Ensure that your form submission logic correctly awaits the database operation before navigating to the feed page.

### **2. Displaying Feedback During Form Submission (Loading State)**

- **Why It's Important:**  
    Users expect some feedback while their action is being processed. This ensures that they don't think the app is stuck or unresponsive.
    
- **Key Concept:**
    
    - **Use the `useFormStatus` hook** from React to track the status of the form submission.
        
    - This hook provides the `pending` state, which can be used to display a loading message instead of the buttons while the form is being submitted.
        
        ```js
        const { pending } = useFormStatus();
        
        return pending ? <p>Creating post...</p> : <button>Submit</button>;
        ```
        
- **What You Need to Do:**
    
    - Implement the `useFormStatus` hook in a **separate client-side component**.
        
    - Switch out the submit button with a **loading message** when the form is being submitted.
        
    - Use the `use client` directive to ensure the component is client-side.

### **3. Redirecting After Submission**

- **Why It's Important:**  
    Once the form is submitted and the post is saved, the user should be redirected to the feed page. This improves the user experience and guides them to the next relevant step.
    
- **Key Concept:**
    
    - Use the `redirect()` function from Next.js after awaiting the form submission to ensure smooth redirection to the `/feed` page.
        
        ```js
        redirect('/feed');
        ```
        
- **What You Need to Do:**
    
    - Once the form is submitted and the data is successfully saved to the database, implement the redirection logic in the `createPost` function.
        

---

### **4. Client-Side Component for Form Status**

- **Why It's Important:**  
    The logic for form submission feedback (loading message, etc.) needs to be in a **separate component** that is a **client-side component** because `useFormStatus` can only be used in client components.
    
- **Key Concept:**
    
    - Create a new `FormSubmit` component inside `components/form-submit.js` and use the `useFormStatus` hook inside it.
        
    - Make sure the component has the `use client` directive to mark it as a client-side component.
        
        ```js
        'use client';
        import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';
        
        function FormSubmit() {
          const { pending } = useFormStatus();
          return pending ? <p>Creating post...</p> : <button>Submit</button>;
        }
        ```
        
- **What You Need to Do:**
    
    - Move the button logic (for showing loading or submit buttons) into this new `FormSubmit` component.
        
    - Make sure to wrap this component inside the form tags for it to work.

### **5. Rendering Fallback Text While Waiting for Submission**

- **Why It's Important:**  
    Displaying feedback while waiting for form submission helps prevent confusion. Instead of just disabling the buttons, show a **message** or loading indicator that informs the user the form is being processed.
    
- **Key Concept:**
    
    - If the form is in a **pending** state, show a loading message like `"Creating post..."`.
        
        ```js
        return pending ? <p>Creating post...</p> : <button>Submit</button>;
        ```
        
- **What You Need to Do:**
    
    - Ensure the fallback content is displayed while the form is submitting, and the submit button is hidden or replaced.

### **Summary of What Youâ€™ve Already Done vs. Whatâ€™s Missing:**

1. **What Youâ€™ve Already Done:**
    
    - Store the post to the database.
        
    - Redirect the user after form submission (this is something youâ€™ve likely done in some form already).
        
2. **Whatâ€™s Missing or Needs Enhancement:**
    
    - Use the `useFormStatus` hook to track the form submission state and show appropriate feedback (loading state).
        
    - Make sure the redirection happens only **after** the submission finishes.
        
    - Implement the fallback content and loading state inside a **client-side** component.
