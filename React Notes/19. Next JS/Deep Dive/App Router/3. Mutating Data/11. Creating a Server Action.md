## ✅ Goal: Convert a **Client Form Action** into a **Server Action**

### 🔁 From:

- Traditional form with `onSubmit` and a client-side `fetch()` or API call.
    

### 🔄 To:

- Native `<form action={myServerAction}>` powered by React Server Components and **Server Actions** in the **App Router**.
    

---

## ⚙️ Requirements for a Server Action

1. **Must be an `async` function**
    
2. **Must include `'use server'` directive**
    
3. **Must live in a Server Component**
    
4. **The `<form>` must use the `action={myServerAction}` attribute**
    

---

### ✅ Basic Example

```tsx
// app/posts/page.tsx (a Server Component by default)

export default function NewPostPage() {
  return (
    <form action={createPost}>
      <input type="text" name="title" placeholder="Title" />
      <textarea name="content" placeholder="Content" />
      <input type="file" name="image" />
      <button type="submit">Create Post</button>
    </form>
  );
}

// This is the Server Action 👇
async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  'use server';

  const title = formData.get('title');
  const content = formData.get('content');
  const image = formData.get('image'); // Might be a File or null

  console.log('📝 Title:', title);
  console.log('📄 Content:', content);
  console.log('🖼️ Image:', image);
}
```

## 🔍 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

> When you submit the form, **Next.js serializes the data**, sends it to your own server, and invokes `createPost()` — **automatically**.  
> No need to write `fetch()`, no need for API routes.

It’s like using traditional HTML forms… but with modern server-side power.

## 💥 Common Errors to Avoid

### ❌ Missing `'use server'`

You'll get a runtime error like:

> `Server Actions must include the 'use server' directive.`

### ❌ Missing `async`

Another runtime error will say:

> `Server Actions must be async functions.`

## 📥 Working with File Uploads

If you want to handle file uploads, like images:

- Your `<form>` must include `enctype="multipart/form-data"` (optional in most modern setups — but good practice).
    
- `formData.get('image')` will give you a `File` object.
    
- You can then:
    
    - Store it to disk (if using a local file system).
        
    - Upload it to cloud storage (e.g. S3, Cloudinary).
        
    - Store the metadata in your DB.

## 🧠 Final Takeaways

✅ **Server Actions simplify form handling**  
✅ You don’t need `fetch()`, `onSubmit`, or custom API routes  
✅ You just need:

```ts
'use server'
async function myAction(formData: FormData) { ... }
```

And connect it via:

```tsx
<form action={myAction}>...</form>
```
