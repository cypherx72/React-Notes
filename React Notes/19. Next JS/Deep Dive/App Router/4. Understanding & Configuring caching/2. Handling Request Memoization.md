### **Overview**
- The transcript describes a **Next.js application** fetching data from a **dummy backend server** (a separate process running in the background).
- The application sends **two requests** to the backend from different components (layout and page), but **request memoization** in Next.js is designed to avoid duplicate requests to the same data source.
- The example illustrates how request memoization works, why duplicate requests occur in this case, and how to ensure it functions as intended.

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Request Memoization in Next.js**:
   - A mechanism to prevent duplicate requests to the same data source during a single server request cycle.
   - Only applies when requests have **identical configurations** (e.g., same URL, headers, and other fetch options).
   - Reduces unnecessary network calls by reusing the response from a single request across multiple components.

2. **Application Setup**:
   - The Next.js app has a `messages` folder with:
     - **layout.js**: Contains one `fetch` request to the backend to retrieve messages.
     - **page.js**: Contains another `fetch` request to the same backend.
   - The backend logs each incoming request, allowing observation of request behavior.

3. **Observed Behavior**:
   - Initially, **two backend request logs** appear when the messages page is loaded, indicating two separate requests from `layout.js` and `page.js`.
   - This seems to contradict request memoization, which should deduplicate requests to the same data source.

4. **Reason for Duplicate Requests**:
   - The two `fetch` requests have **different configurations** due to unique **headers** set in each request.
   - Headers are used to identify the request source (layout vs. page) in backend logs, but this difference prevents Next.js from recognizing them as identical.
   - Request memoization only works for requests with the **exact same signature** (URL, headers, etc.).

5. **Fixing Duplicate Requests**:
   - Remove the differing headers from both `fetch` requests in `layout.js` and `page.js` to make them identical.
   - After saving the changes and reloading the messages page:
     - Only **one request** is logged in the backend, demonstrating request memoization in action.
     - The single response is reused across both components.

### **Practical Steps to Observe Request Memoization**
1. **Check Backend Logs**:
   - Open the terminal running the backend server.
   - Reload the messages page in the Next.js app.
   - Look for log messages indicating incoming requests.
   - Initially, expect **two logs** (one from each request).

2. **Troubleshooting Missing Logs**:
   - If no logs appear:
     - Delete the `.next` folder in the Next انگلیسی project (contains temporary and cache data).
     - Stop and restart both the **backend server** and **Next.js development server**.
     - Reload the messages page again to confirm logs.

3. **Resetting the Cache**:
   - The `.next` folder stores cache data (e.g., for the data cache or full route cache).
   - Deleting it and restarting the Next.js development server recreates it with fresh data, resetting any cached responses.
   - This ensures accurate observation of request behavior.

4. **Testing Request Memoization**:
   - Modify `layout.js` and `page.js` to use identical `fetch` requests (remove differing headers).
   - Save changes, restart servers if needed, and reload the page.
   - Confirm only **one backend request** is logged, indicating memoization is working.

### **Additional Insights**
- **Why No New Request Sometimes?**:
  - After removing headers, reloading the page may not trigger a new backend request due to other Next.js caching mechanisms (e.g., **data cache** or **full route cache**).
  - Deleting the `.next` folder resets these caches, ensuring fresh requests for testing.

- **Impact of Headers**:
  - Headers were used to log the request source (layout vs. page) on the backend.
  - Without headers, the backend cannot distinguish the source, but memoization reduces the request count to one.

- **Broader Application**:
  - Request memoization applies to `fetch` requests to external backends (as shown here).
  - Later content will cover deduplicating requests to other data sources (e.g., direct database queries within the Next.js app).

- **Free Optimization**:
  - Request memoization is a built-in Next.js feature, requiring no extra configuration when requests are identical.
  - Developers benefit from reduced network calls and faster performance automatically.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Request Memoization**:
  - Prevents duplicate `fetch` requests to the same data source within a single server request cycle.
  - Requires identical request configurations (URL, headers, etc.).
- **Duplicate Requests**:
  - Occur if requests differ (e.g., due to unique headers, as in the initial setup).
  - Can be resolved by standardizing request configurations.
- **Cache Management**:
  - The `.next` folder stores cache data; deleting it resets caches for testing.
  - Restarting servers ensures fresh behavior when troubleshooting.
- **Practical Testing**:
  - Use backend logs to verify request counts.
  - Modify code to test memoization by ensuring identical `fetch` calls.
