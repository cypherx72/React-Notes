### 🧠 **Context Recap**

Previously, you may have:

- Used `fetch()` to call external APIs.
    
- Leveraged Next.js’s built-in caching and deduplication features for `fetch()`.
    

But now the scenario changes:

- You're no longer using `fetch()` — instead, you’re directly querying a **custom database (SQLite)**.
    
- This means **Next.js’s built-in caching won't apply**, and you’ll need to manage cache and deduplication manually.
    

---

### 🔍 **What's Happening**

1. **Using a SQLite Database Locally**
    
    - A `getMessages()` function (from `lib/`) queries the database.
        
    - It’s **synchronous** because `better-sqlite3` doesn’t use promises.
        
    - So there's no `async/await` needed in your components.
        
2. **No Caching by Default**
    
    - When `getMessages()` is called from both the `page` and the `layout`, it hits the database **twice**.
        
    - This is inefficient and unnecessary — **no request deduplication is occurring**.
        
3. **How to Fix It: Use React's `cache()` Function**
    
    - React provides a `cache()` utility that wraps any function and automatically **deduplicates requests** during a single render cycle.
        
    - This is what enables **shared results** across multiple places in the same request.

### ✅ **Steps to Implement Request Deduplication**

#### 1. **Wrap `getMessages` using React’s `cache()`**

```js
import { cache } from 'react';

export const getMessages = cache(() => {
  // Your DB querying logic here (e.g., SQLite SELECT)
});
```

#### 2. **Use the cached version everywhere**

```js
const messages = getMessages(); // now deduplicated across layout/page
```

#### 3. **Result**

- On every page load, the database is queried **only once**, even if multiple components (like layout + page) call the same `getMessages` function.
    
- This optimizes performance and avoids redundant database queries.

### ⚠️ **What About Caching in Production?**

- In **development**, there is no **Full Route Cache**, so changes reflect immediately.
    
- In **production**, after `npm run build`:
    
    - Static routes are **pre-rendered and cached**.
        
    - Any new messages added _after_ build time won't appear **unless** you make the route **dynamic**.
        

---

### 💡 Pro Tip

To disable static caching in production and make your route dynamic:

```ts
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'; // in your page file
```

---

### 🔄 **In Summary**

|Concern|Solution|
|---|---|
|Redundant DB queries|Wrap function in `React.cache()`|
|Static page cache in prod|Use `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`|
|Async not required|Use sync functions with `better-sqlite3`|


---

### 🧠 Context:

You're no longer using `fetch()` to get external data — instead, you're directly querying a **local SQLite database** using custom functions like `getMessages()` and `addMessage()` inside your Next.js app.

But now you want:

- ✅ **Request deduplication** — avoid multiple calls for the same data in a single request cycle.
    
- ✅ **Data caching** — persist responses between requests to avoid redundant DB hits.
    

---

### ✅ Step 1: **Request Deduplication** (with `React.cache`)

React provides a built-in way to deduplicate synchronous or promise-returning functions during a single render cycle:

```tsx
import { cache } from 'react'

const getMessages = cache(() => {
  console.log('Fetching messages from DB')
  return db.prepare('SELECT * FROM messages').all()
})
```

📌 **What it does:**

- Caches the result _during a single request cycle_ (e.g., rendering both layout and page).
    
- Prevents duplicate DB calls within that cycle.
    

---

### ✅ Step 2: **Data Caching** (with `unstable_cache` from `next/cache`)

To cache results _across request cycles_ (like between user visits or on build):

```tsx
import { unstable_cache as nextCache } from 'next/cache'

const getMessages = nextCache(
  cache(() => {
    console.log('Fetching messages from DB')
    return db.prepare('SELECT * FROM messages').all()
  }),
  ['messages']  // cache key
)
```

🛠️ You **must** now:

- Add `async`/`await` back in your components:
    

```tsx
export default async function MessagesPage() {
  const messages = await getMessages()
  ...
}
```

📌 **What it does:**

- Adds persistent caching.
    
- Avoids DB hits unless cache is invalidated or expired.
    
- Cache key (`['messages']`) helps Next.js internally differentiate entries.
    

---

### 🧪 Observations:

- **Dev Mode:** Full route cache and data caching are disabled or less strict.
    
- **Production Build (`npm run build`):**
    
    - Full route cache kicks in.
        
    - Without caching tweaks, newly added DB data won’t show up unless invalidation is handled.
        

---

### ⚠️ Common Gotchas:

- Once `unstable_cache` is applied, your function **returns a Promise**. Be sure to `await` it everywhere.
    
- `['messages']` is just an internal cache key — **not the same** as **cache tags**. You’ll learn how to use **tags** for invalidation later.
