## 🔐 Authentication Flow – Core Concepts

### ✅ **Authentication is a Two-Part Process**

1. **Log Users In**
    
    - Verify user credentials (email + password).
        
    - If valid, mark the user as authenticated.
        
2. **Access Control**
    
    - Restrict access to protected routes.
        
    - Grant access only if the user is marked authenticated.
        

---

## 🧾 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. **User Sends Login Request**

- A user submits a login form with **email and password**.
    
- This data is sent via an HTTP request to the server.
    

### 2. **Verify Credentials on the Server**

- Server receives and checks:
    
    - Does this email exist in the `users` table?
        
    - Does the submitted password match the stored (hashed) password?
        
- If **invalid** → return an error to the user.
    
- If **valid** → proceed to create a session.

## 📌 Creating a Session

### What is a Session?

- A **record in the `sessions` table** that maps a user to a session ID.
    
- Example fields:
    
    - `session_id` (random string, hard to guess)
        
    - `user_id`
        
    - `expiration` timestamp (optional)
        

### How the Session Works:

- When a user logs in successfully:
    
    - Server generates a **unique session ID**.
        
    - Stores this in the `sessions` table.
        
    - Sends it back to the client inside a **cookie**.
        

---

## 🍪 Sending the Session to the Client

- The session ID is **sent back in a cookie**.
    
- Example: `Set-Cookie: session=abc123...; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure`
    

### Why a Cookie?

- Browsers automatically include cookies in subsequent requests.
    
- This lets us **track the session across pages** without requiring the user to re-login.
    

---

## 🧪 Accessing Protected Routes

### What Happens on a Protected Page Request:

1. Browser sends a request to `/training` or another protected route.
    
2. This request includes the `session` cookie.
    
3. Server reads the cookie, extracts the session ID.
    
4. Server checks if that ID exists in the `sessions` table:
    
    - **Valid session** → grant access.
        
    - **Missing/invalid/expired session** → deny access or redirect to login.
        

---

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

- **Session IDs** must be:
    
    - Long & random (hard to guess)
        
    - Unique
        
    - Stored securely in cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`)
        
- **Expired sessions** should be deleted or invalidated.

## 🧱 Summary Table

|Step|Description|
|---|---|
|1. Submit|User sends login form (email + password)|
|2. Verify|Server checks credentials|
|3. Create|If valid → create session in DB|
|4. Send|Return session ID as cookie|
|5. Use|Client includes cookie in future requests|
|6. Protect|Server checks session ID on protected routes|

---

## 🔄 What's Next?

> Now that you understand the _why_, the next implementation steps are:

-  Build a `loginUser` function to verify credentials
    
-  Create a `sessions` table in your database
    
-  Generate and store secure session IDs
    
-  Use `set-cookie` headers in the response
    
-  Write middleware or route guards to check sessions for protected pages

## 🔐 Implementing Authentication in Next.js (App Router)

### 🎯 Goal

To implement full authentication using a library instead of doing everything manually. This covers:

- Logging users in
    
- Managing sessions
    
- Securing protected routes
    

---

## 🛠️ Why Use an Auth Library?

### The Challenge:

Manual authentication involves:

- Verifying credentials
    
- Creating & managing session IDs
    
- Setting HTTP-only cookies
    
- Validating session cookies on every protected route
    

All this is **tedious and error-prone** when done from scratch.

### The Solution:

Use a **library** that abstracts this logic and handles it securely.

---

## 📦 Library Choices

### 1. **Lucia Auth** (💡 Chosen)

- Modern, popular, and **framework-agnostic**.
    
- Supports **Next.js**, **Bun**, **Deno**, **Cloudflare Workers**, etc.
    
- Simple, **straightforward API**.
    
- Actively maintained.
    

### 2. **NextAuth.js**

- Also popular and built with **Next.js in mind**.
    
- As of the time of recording:
    
    - ⚠️ **Not working well with the App Router**.
        
    - 🧾 Poor documentation.
        
    - ❌ Bugs/issues related to route handling and session consistency.
        

---

## ✅ Why Lucia Was Chosen for This Section

- Works well with App Router.
    
- Better developer experience (DX).
    
- Easier configuration and cleaner setup.
    
- Supports **SQLite** natively via adapters.
    

---

## 📦 Required Installations

```bash
npm install lucia
npm install @lucia-auth/adapter-sqlite
```

- `lucia`: The core library
    
- `@lucia-auth/adapter-sqlite`: Adapter to store sessions and users in your **SQLite database**
    

---

## 🔌 Lucia with SQLite

### How It Works:

- Lucia will:
    
    - **Create sessions** when users log in
        
    - **Store those sessions** in the SQLite database using the adapter
        
    - **Validate cookies** for protected route access
        

You just need to:

- Wire up Lucia with the adapter
    
- Define how users are stored
    
- Hook it into your routes
    

---

## 🚀 What Happens Next?

1. **Install Lucia + adapter** ✅
    
2. **Configure Lucia** with:
    
    - The adapter
        
    - A user schema
        
    - Session rules
        
3. **Implement login & session creation**
    
4. **Set cookies properly (secure, HttpOnly)**
    
5. **Create middleware to protect routes**
