### 🚨 Now comes the **big league**: **Authentication**

This isn’t just a "bonus" topic — it’s **mission-critical** for any real-world app. Without authentication, your app is just a fancy brochure. With it, it becomes a full-fledged, user-driven platform.

Here’s what you’re about to tackle:

---

### 🔐 1. **User Signup**

- Creating new users
    
- Storing their credentials securely (usually hashed with bcrypt)
    
- Optionally verifying emails
    

### 🔓 2. **User Login**

- Validating credentials
    
- Creating a session or issuing a JWT
    
- Handling login/logout state
    

### 🛡️ 3. **Protected Routes**

- Making certain pages accessible **only** to logged-in users
    
- Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data or actions (like dashboards, uploads, admin panels)
    

---

### 🧠 Two major approaches in Next.js:

#### 1. **Session-based Authentication**

- Typically done with something like `NextAuth.js`
    
- Works well with the **App Router**
    
- Uses **server-side sessions**, cookies
    
- Easy integration with providers like Google, GitHub, etc.
    

#### 2. **JWT-based Authentication**

- Good for custom backend APIs
    
- Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies (secure) or localStorage (less secure)
    
- Pairs well with REST or GraphQL APIs
    

---

### ⚙️ What you’ll build and learn:

- How to structure authentication logic in Next.js
    
- Where to store tokens or sessions securely
    
- How to **protect server components**, API routes, and UI routes
    
- How to **persist login state** across sessions
    

---

### 🧩 Your Next Steps:

- Pick a method (NextAuth for simplicity, custom JWT for flexibility)
    
- Create auth flows (signup/login/logout)
    
- Protect routes using **middleware**, **server-side checks**, or **Client Components** that redirect

Below is a concrete next step: finishing your **`signup` Server Action** so that when **valid data** is submitted, you:

1. Hash the password
    
2. Insert the new user into the database
    
3. Return a “success” flag (or perhaps redirect)
    

I’ll also show you how to tweak your form to handle that successful‑signup case.

---

## 1. Complete `signup` in **`actions/auth-actions.js`**

```js
'use server';

import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
import { db } from '../lib/database'; // adjust import to your DB helper

export async function signup(prevState, formData) {
  // 1) Extract
  const email    = formData.get('email')?.toString().trim() || '';
  const password = formData.get('password')?.toString().trim() || '';

  // 2) Validate
  const errors = {};
  if (!email.includes('@')) {
    errors.email = 'Please enter a valid email address.';
  }
  if (password.length < 8) {
    errors.password = 'Password must be at least 8 characters long.';
  }
  if (Object.keys(errors).length > 0) {
    return { errors };
  }

  // 3) Hash & insert
  const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);
  await db.prepare(
    'INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES (?, ?)'
  ).run(email, hash);

  // 4) Indicate success (no errors)
  return { success: true };
}
```

> **Notes:**
> 
> - We kept the two‑argument signature (`prevState, formData`) so `useFormState` can wire up errors.
>     
> - You may want to catch unique‑email constraint violations and return an error object in that case, too.
>     

---

## 2. Hook up success handling in **`auth-form.js`**

```jsx
'use client';

import { useFormState } from 'react-dom';
import { signup }        from '../actions/auth-actions';

export default function AuthForm() {
  const [formState, formAction] = useFormState(signup, {});

  // If signup succeeded, you might redirect or show a message:
  if (formState.success) {
    return (
      <div className="p-4 bg-green-100">
        🎉 Account created successfully! Please log in.
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <form action={formAction} className="space-y-4">
      {/* email input */}
      <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" required />
      {/* password input */}
      <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required />

      {/* validation errors */}
      {formState.errors && (
        <ul id="form-errors" className="text-red-600">
          {Object.keys(formState.errors).map((field) => (
            <li key={field}>{formState.errors[field]}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}

      <button type="submit" className="btn btn-primary">
        Create Account
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

> **Notes:**
> 
> - We check `formState.success` to render a success message (you could also redirect using `useRouter().push('/login')`).
>     
> - `formState.errors` still drives the error list as before.
>     

---

### 3. Next Steps & Enhancements

- **Unique‑Email Check:** wrap your insert in a `try/catch` and if the DB throws a “unique constraint failed” error, return `{ errors: { email: 'Email already in use.' } }`.
    
- **Email Normalization:** consider lower‑casing emails.
    
- **Redirect on Success:** instead of showing a message, you can `return redirect('/login')` from your Server Action (App Router only).
    
- **Session Creation:** after signup, you could auto‑log them in by creating a session or issuing a cookie.
    

With this in place, you now have a **fully functional signup flow**: invalid inputs are flagged immediately, and valid inputs create a new user in your database. Next up: building your **login** action and protecting routes!
