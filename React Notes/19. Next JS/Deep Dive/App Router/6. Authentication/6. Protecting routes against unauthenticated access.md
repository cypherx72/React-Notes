### âœ… **Objective**

To protect routes/pages by checking if the request comes from a user with a valid authentication session, and redirect unauthenticated users.

### ðŸ”’ **Using `verifyAuth` to Protect a Page**

1. **Import and Call `verifyAuth` Early**  
    At the top of a **protected page** (like `/training`), you immediately:
    
    ```js
    const result = await verifyAuth();
    ```
    
2. **Check Authentication Result**  
    The result object contains:
    
    ```js
    { user, session } // both might be null
    ```
    
    So you verify:
    
    ```js
    if (!result.user) {
      redirect('/'); // using `redirect` from Next.js to bounce unauthenticated users
    }
    ```
    
3. **Behavior**
    
    - If the session is valid, the user stays on the protected page.
        
    - If the session is **invalid or missing**, the user is **redirected to `/`**.
        
    - This protects server-side rendered (SSR) pages, and avoids any sensitive data fetching for unauthenticated users.

### ðŸ§ª **Test Case Walkthrough**

- **Logged in**: Reloading `/training` works fine â€” because the auth session cookie exists and is valid.
    
- **Delete cookie manually in DevTools**: Reloading `/training` now **redirects** to `/` â€” because there's no valid session.

### ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway**

You now have **SSR route protection**. Any page or API route that shouldn't be accessible without login can call `verifyAuth()` and redirect unauthorized users away.

### ðŸ”œ Next Step

The instructor mentioned adding:

- A **logout button** to clear the auth session.
    
- A **login mechanism** (since so far, only user creation is implemented).
    

These are the next critical pieces to make the full authentication system functional and user-friendly.
