### Why remove `<html>` and `<body>` in `(auth)/layout.js`?

- The **main root layout** (`app/layout.js`) is the _only_ place where `<html>`, `<body>`, and other root-level tags should live.
    
- Any nested layouts — like your `(auth)/layout.js` — get **injected inside** that root layout.
    
- If your nested layout includes its own `<html>` or `<body>`, you end up with nested HTML tags, which is invalid HTML and can cause unexpected behavior.
    
- Technically, your app will still work, but it’s semantically incorrect and potentially fragile.

### What happens if you create multiple route groups with layouts?

- If you create multiple groups like `(auth)/layout.js` and `(unauth)/layout.js`, both with their own `<html>` and `<body>`, then you actually have multiple root layouts.
    
- In that case, Next.js treats those as independent roots for those route groups.
    
- This is a special case and can be useful if you want completely separate layout shells for different parts of your app (e.g., public vs authenticated).
    
- But if you only have one root layout (`app/layout.js`), nested layouts must **not** contain `<html>` or `<body>`.

### So what should `(auth)/layout.js` look like?

```jsx
import '../globals.css';

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Next Auth',
  description: 'Next.js Authentication',
};

export default function AuthRootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <header id="auth-header">
        <p>Welcome back!</p>
        <form>
          <button>Logout</button>
        </form>
      </header>
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
```

- Notice **no `<html>` or `<body>`** here.
    
- Just a React fragment wrapping your header and children.
    
- `globals.css` import stays for styling.
    
- Metadata here will merge or override the root metadata as needed.
    

---

### TL;DR

- **One root layout per app** is the default and recommended.
    
- Nested layouts inside route groups should never include `<html>` or `<body>`.
    
- Multiple root layouts only if you want completely separate layout shells for distinct route groups.

This keeps your DOM clean and your app structure aligned with Next.js expectations.
