### Step-by-step of your logout implementation

1. **Add `logout` Server Action**  
    This will be the function your frontend form calls when the logout button is pressed.
    
2. **Create a `destroySession` function in your Lucia auth file**
    
    - This verifies if the user has a valid session (`verifyAuth`).
        
    - If no session exists, it returns an error or throws.
        
    - If the session exists, it invalidates it by deleting it from your sessions DB table (`lucia.invalidateSession`).
        
    - Clears the session cookie by setting a blank cookie (removing it from the browser).
        
3. **`logout` action calls `destroySession` and redirects**
    
    - After destroying the session, redirect the user back to the login or home page.
        
    - This gives a clean UX flow and prevents access to protected pages.
        
4. **Connect the logout form/button to the `logout` Server Action**
    
    - Import the `logout` Server Action in your `(auth)/layout.js`.
        
    - Use that action as the form’s `action` attribute.
        
    - Now when you click logout, the Server Action runs, the session is destroyed, and you get redirected.

### Why this approach is solid and forward-thinking:

- **Server Actions for auth logic:**  
    Keeping logout on the server-side (via Server Actions) ensures security — you’re not relying on client-side hacks or unsafe token clearing.
    
- **Session invalidation:**  
    You fully remove the session server-side, so even if someone kept a cookie, it’s useless because the session no longer exists.
    
- **Clean UI state:**  
    Redirecting after logout prevents stale UI states and immediately stops access to protected pages.
    
- **Route protection works:**  
    Your training page (and any other protected page) will check session and redirect if invalid, so logout truly locks users out.

### Next steps / tips:

- **Add error handling:**  
    If `destroySession` fails or no session is found, handle that gracefully (redirect anyway or show a message).
    
- **Enhance UX:**  
    Add a loading state or confirmation message on logout for smoother experience.
    
- **Extend session logic:**  
    You can later add token refresh, multi-device logout, or session expiry.
