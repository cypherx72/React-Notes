Here’s a deep dive into **why** Next.js complains and **what’s going on** under the hood when you add `getStaticProps` to a dynamic route:

---

## 1. The Core Issue: Dynamic Routes + `getStaticProps`

- **Static Generation default**
    
    - For **non-dynamic** pages (`about.js`, `index.js`), Next.js will pre-render at build time by default.
        
- **Dynamic pages** (`[pid].js`) are special:
    
    - They represent _many_ possible URLs (e.g. `/1`, `/2`, `/1000`).
        
    - Next.js can’t know ahead of time which `pid` values you’ll need.
        
    - **So by default**, dynamic routes are rendered **on-demand**, not pre-generated.
        

---

## 2. What Changes When You Add `getStaticProps`?

- Exporting `getStaticProps` signals:
    
    > “I want this page _pre_-rendered with data before it’s served.”
    
- On a dynamic page, this conflicts with the on-demand default:
    
    - Next.js now _must_ pre-render, but has no clue _which_ pages to build.
        

Hence the error:

> **“`getStaticPaths` is required for dynamic SSG pages.”**

---

## 3. Why Next.js Needs `getStaticPaths`

### 🔍 Discovery vs. Declaration

- **Discovery problem**: Next.js can't “crawl” your data at build time and find all IDs automatically.
    
- **Declaration solution**: You explicitly list the IDs you know now, so Next.js can pre-generate those pages.
    

### What `getStaticPaths` Does

1. **Exports an array of path-objects**
    
    ```js
    export async function getStaticPaths() {
      return {
        paths: [
          { params: { pid: '1' } },
          { params: { pid: '2' } },
          // …and so on
        ],
        fallback: false
      };
    }
    ```
    
2. **`paths`** tells Next.js exactly which pages to pre-render.
    
3. **`fallback`** controls behavior for unknown IDs (more on that later).
    

---

## 4. Putting It All Together

1. **`getStaticPaths`** runs first at build time:
    
    - Gathers `pid` values you want (e.g., by reading your JSON file).
        
    - Returns a `paths` array of `{ params: { pid } }`.
        
2. For **each** entry in `paths`, Next.js runs **`getStaticProps`** with that `pid`:
    
    - You fetch the single product’s data.
        
    - You return `props` that the page component renders.
        
3. Next.js generates a separate HTML file for each dynamic route:
    
    - `/1` → built with product 1
        
    - `/2` → built with product 2
        
    - etc.
        

---

## 5. Example Workflow

```js
// pages/[pid].js

import fs from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // 1️⃣ Read data source
  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'data', 'dummy-backend.json');
  const raw = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
  const { products } = JSON.parse(raw);

  // 2️⃣ Build list of paths
  const paths = products.map(prod => ({
    params: { pid: prod.id.toString() }
  }));

  return { paths, fallback: false };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // 3️⃣ Fetch data for one page
  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'data', 'dummy-backend.json');
  const raw = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
  const { products } = JSON.parse(raw);

  const loadedProduct = products.find(p => p.id.toString() === params.pid);

  return { props: { loadedProduct } };
}

export default function ProductDetail({ loadedProduct }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{loadedProduct.title}</h1>
      <p>{loadedProduct.description}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

## 6. `fallback` Modes at a Glance

|Mode|Behavior|When to Use|
|---|---|---|
|`false`|Only the listed `paths` exist; all others → 404|Small, known data sets|
|`true`|Unlisted pages show fallback UI, then generate in background and cache upon first request|Large data sets, UX can show a loader|
|`'blocking'`|Unlisted pages generate on-demand _before_ serving (no loader flicker)|SEO-critical pages, large datasets|

---

### 🔧 Best Practice

1. **Start with `fallback: false`** when you know all IDs.
    
2. Switch to `true` or `'blocking'` when your dataset grows too large to pre-render _everything_ at build time.
    

---

## 7. Final Takeaway

- **Dynamic + SSG** requires both `getStaticPaths` **and** `getStaticProps`.
    
- You’re declaring _what_ to build (paths) and _how_ to fetch data (props).
    
- This gives you **fast**, **SEO-friendly** dynamic pages without client-side fetching.
    

Use this blueprint whenever you need detail pages for products, posts, profiles, etc. It’s the heart of Next.js’s static-generation power!

---
Here’s a deep dive into how your `getStaticPaths` function works, why Next.js needs it, and what each part means:

---

## 1. Why `getStaticPaths` Is Required

- **Dynamic routes** (`pages/[pid].js`) potentially map to _many_ URLs (e.g. `/p1`, `/p2`, `/p3`, …, `/p1000`).
    
- By default, Next.js **cannot** pre-generate pages for a dynamic route unless you tell it exactly **which** URLs to build.
    
- Exporting `getStaticProps` tells Next.js “I want SSG for this page,” but it still has no idea **which** `pid` values you need.
    
- **Solution**: `getStaticPaths` explicitly lists those values so Next.js can:
    
    1. Generate the HTML at build time (or ISR time) for each path.
        
    2. Know which pages to serve and which to 404 (when `fallback: false`).
        

---

## 2. Anatomy of `getStaticPaths`

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    // 1️⃣ paths: an array of route parameter objects
    paths: [
      { params: { pid: 'p1' } },
      { params: { pid: 'p2' } },
      { params: { pid: 'p3' } },
    ],
    // 2️⃣ fallback: controls behavior for any other pid
    fallback: false
  };
}
```

### 2.1 `paths` Array

- Each element corresponds to **one URL** that Next.js should pre-render.
    
- The `params` object matches your file’s dynamic segment names:
    
    - For `pages/[pid].js`, you use `params.pid`.
        
- In your example:
    
    - `{ params: { pid: 'p1' } }` → pre-generate `/p1`
        
    - `{ params: { pid: 'p2' } }` → pre-generate `/p2`
        
    - `{ params: { pid: 'p3' } }` → pre-generate `/p3`
        

> 🔍 Under the hood: Next.js will call your `getStaticProps({ params: { pid: 'p1' } })`, then again for `p2`, then `p3`, producing three separate HTML files in `.next/server/pages`.

### 2.2 `fallback` Mode

Controls what happens when a user visits `/pid` **not listed** in `paths`.

|Value|Behavior|
|---|---|
|`false`|Any URL not in `paths` → **404 page**|
|`true`|Non-listed URL → initially renders a “fallback” page (you define a loading state), then runs `getStaticProps` on-demand, caches result, and populates the real page when it’s ready|
|`'blocking'`|Non-listed URL → **blocks** the request until the page is generated on the server, then serves it (no loading UI)|

In your case, `fallback: false` means:

- Only `/p1`, `/p2`, `/p3` exist.
    
- Visiting, say, `/p4` will immediately show Next.js’s 404.
    

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Build Phase** (`npm run build` or ISR on first request)
    
    - Next.js runs `getStaticPaths()`.
        
    - It collects all `paths` and schedules them for SSG.
        
2. **Per-Path Pre-render**  
    For each entry in `paths`:
    
    - Next.js invokes `getStaticProps({ params })`.
        
    - Your code reads the JSON file, filters for the matching `pid`, and returns props.
        
    - Next.js writes out an HTML file (and JSON data for hydration).
        
3. **Serving**
    
    - `/p1`, `/p2`, `/p3` serve the pre-generated HTML instantly.
        
    - Any other route:
        
        - With `fallback: false` → 404.
            
        - With `true` or `'blocking'` → on-demand behavior.
            

---

## 4. Next Steps & Best Practices

- **Don’t hard-code** in real apps. Instead, read your data source (e.g. JSON file, database) inside `getStaticPaths`, map its IDs to `paths`.
    
- Choose `fallback` based on dataset size:
    
    - **Small, known** (e.g. 10–20 items) → `false`
        
    - **Large or growing** (e.g. hundreds of blog posts) → `'blocking'`
        
    - **You need a spinner** → `true` with client-side loading UI
        
- Combine with **ISR** by adding a `revalidate` field in `getStaticProps` to keep pages fresh over time.
    

---

By providing `getStaticPaths`, you’re giving Next.js the **blueprint** of exactly which dynamic pages to build—and with `getStaticProps`, you supply the **data** for each one. Together, they unlock static site generation for dynamic routes, giving you fast, SEO-friendly pages without client-side fetch bloat.


Let’s dive deep into the **`fallback`** option in **`getStaticPaths`**, because it controls how Next.js handles routes **not** pre-generated at build/ISR time.

---

## 1. `fallback: false`

### ✅ Behavior

- **Only** the routes you returned in `paths` are generated.
    
- Any other URL → **immediate 404**.
    

### 🔍 What Happens

- Build/ISR: Next.js writes out `.next/server/pages/[pid].html` only for your listed IDs.
    
- Runtime:
    
    - Visiting `/p1`, `/p2`, `/p3` → serve the static HTML.
        
    - Visiting `/p4` → straight to the 404 page.
        

### 💡 Use When

- **Small, fixed** sets of pages you know up front (e.g., 5–20 products).
    
- You want **zero client-side loading logic**.
    
- You’re okay with a true “not found” for anything else.
    

---

## 2. `fallback: true`

### ✅ Behavior

1. **Pre-generated** pages from `paths` are served immediately.
    
2. **Unlisted** pages on first visit:
    
    - Next.js serves your page component in a “fallback” state (you must render a loading UI).
        
    - **Simultaneously**, it runs `getStaticProps` on the server for that new URL.
        
    - Once data returns, Next.js **hydrates** with real props and caches the HTML & JSON for subsequent visits.
        

### 🔍 What Happens

- Build/ISR: only your listed IDs get HTML + JSON.
    
- Runtime:
    
    1. User hits `/p4`.
        
    2. Browser shows your “Loading…” state.
        
    3. Server generates `/p4.html` + `/p4.json`, caches them.
        
    4. Page updates to real content.
        
    5. Next visitors to `/p4` see the cached static page instantly.
        

### 💡 Use When

- **Large or growing** datasets where you can’t pre-build everything.
    
- You’re okay showing a **loader** on first visit.
    
- You want most pages instant, but can tolerate a bit of on-demand work.
    

---

## 3. `fallback: 'blocking'`

### ✅ Behavior

- Like `true`, but **no client-side “Loading”** UI.
    
- On first visit to an unlisted URL:
    
    1. Next.js **blocks** the request on the server until `getStaticProps` finishes.
        
    2. Returns fully-rendered HTML.
        
    3. Caches it for future requests.
        
- **No** intermediate spinner; visitor just waits.
    

### 🔍 What Happens

- Build/ISR: only your listed IDs.
    
- Runtime:
    
    - Visiting `/p4` → server builds `/p4.html` before replying.
        
    - Browser receives complete page (no fallback state).
        
    - Cached for next time.
        

### 💡 Use When

- You need **SEO** and **no-loading UI** on first hit.
    
- You can tolerate slightly longer TTFB for new pages.
    
- You have a large/unbounded dataset.
    

---

## 4. Prefetching & Hydration

Regardless of `fallback`:

- Next.js **automatically prefetches** linked JSON for your dynamic routes when those `<Link>`s appear in view.
    
- On client-side navigation, your SPA instantly hydrates with that JSON—no extra HTTP at click time.
    

With `fallback: false`, prefetching only applies to your known list.  
With `true`/`blocking`, unlisted routes aren’t prefetched until they’re generated and cached.

---

## 5. Choosing the Right Mode

|Mode|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|`false`|Simplest; no loader; 404s for unknown routes|Not scalable for large/growing data|
|`true`|Scalable; pages generated on-demand; progressive|Must implement loading UI; slight UX shift on first load|
|`'blocking'`|Scalable; no loader UI; full SEO-friendly HTML|Potentially longer first-response time for new routes|

---

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Prototype** with `fallback: false` if you have a handful of items.
    
2. **Scale up** with `'blocking'` for large catalogs or blogs—preserves SEO and UX.
    
3. **Add client-side refresh** or ISR (`revalidate`) to keep content fresh over time.
    

By mastering these three modes, you’ll have full control over how your dynamic pages are served, delivered, and scaled—balancing build-time costs, runtime performance, and user experience.
