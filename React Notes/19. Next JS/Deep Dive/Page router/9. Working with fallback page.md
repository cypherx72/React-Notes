# What’s Up With `fallback` in `getStaticPaths`?

### Problem it solves:

- **Pre-generating tons of pages** (think millions of products or blog posts) is _impractical_ and _slow_.
    
- Many pages are rarely visited, so pre-building them wastes time and resources.

# The Three Modes Explained Through Your Transcript

### 1. `fallback: false`

- Pre-render only the pages you explicitly list (e.g., product 1, 2, 3).
    
- **Other pages = immediate 404.**
    
- Use if your pages are limited and stable.
    
- _No “loading” UI needed._
    

### 2. `fallback: true`

- Pre-render some pages upfront (say your top sellers).
    
- Other pages **generate on-demand, at runtime, the first time they’re hit**.
    
- The page shows a **loading fallback UI** during this generation (you must implement it).
    
- Once generated, the page is cached and served statically on subsequent requests.
    
- Good for **large, growing sets where some pages are rare**.
    
- But if a user visits an unpre-generated page directly via URL, you _must_ handle the loading state to avoid errors like `cannot read property 'title' of undefined`.
    

### 3. `fallback: 'blocking'`

- Like `true`, but without showing any loading state.
    
- Next.js **waits server-side** for the page generation before responding.
    
- User waits longer on first load but receives a fully rendered page immediately.
    
- No need for fallback UI or loading checks in your component.
    
- Better SEO and user experience if you prefer no “loading” flashes.

# Key Takeaways / What You Should Do

- If your site is small or fixed, use `fallback: false`. Keep it simple.
    
- If you expect a huge or growing number of pages, **use `fallback: true` or `'blocking'`**:
    
    - Use `true` if you want instant feedback with a loading spinner or skeleton UI.
        
    - Use `'blocking'` if you want to avoid showing partial or loading UI and prefer the user waits for the full page to generate.
        
- Always **handle the fallback state** in your React components when using `fallback: true`, to avoid runtime errors and improve UX.
    
- Test direct URL entry and client navigation separately, because behavior differs.

# Forward-Thinking Advice

- Don’t blindly pre-render everything—**be strategic** about what pages truly need to be generated upfront.
    
- Pair `fallback` with **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** (`revalidate`) for fresh, scalable, performant pages.
    
- Monitor your site’s most visited pages and prioritize pre-generation for them—fallback handles the long tail gracefully.
    
- Consider user experience: sometimes a loading state is better than a blank page or long server wait; sometimes blocking is worth the wait for SEO-critical pages.
