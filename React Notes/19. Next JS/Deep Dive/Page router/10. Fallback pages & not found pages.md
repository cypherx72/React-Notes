This transcript nails a crucial nuance in Next.js dynamic static generation—handling **not found (404) scenarios** with fallback pages properly.

# Key Concept: Handling 404 with `fallback: true` in Next.js

### What’s happening?

- You have pages pre-generated for certain IDs (`P1`, `P2`, `P3`).
    
- If you request a non-existent ID (`P4`), by default you get a 404 because `getStaticPaths` only knows those 3.
    
- If you set `fallback: true`, Next.js _allows_ requests for other IDs **but** it will try to fetch the data dynamically on the server _at runtime_.
    

### The problem without handling 404 correctly:

- When you request `P4` with fallback true, the page first shows a fallback state (like a loading spinner) because data isn’t there yet.
    
- Next.js calls `getStaticProps` to fetch product data for `P4`.
    
- Since `P4` doesn’t exist in your data source, fetching fails, and you get an error (like “cannot read property title of undefined”) because your component expects valid product data.
    
- The page crashes instead of gracefully showing a 404.

# The fix: Use `notFound: true` in `getStaticProps`

In your `getStaticProps` function, **after attempting to fetch the product by ID**, check if the product exists:

```js
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const { params } = context;
  const productId = params.pid;
  
  const data = await getData(); // your data fetching logic
  const product = data.products.find(p => p.id === productId);
  
  if (!product) {
    // Return this object to tell Next.js to show the 404 page
    return { notFound: true };
  }
  
  // If product exists, return it as props
  return { props: { product } };
}
```

---

# What this does:

- When Next.js receives `{ notFound: true }`, it immediately renders its built-in 404 page.
    
- This **prevents errors** when someone visits a page that doesn’t exist but fallback is true.
    
- You still get the benefits of fallback (pages not pre-generated can be generated on-demand), but now you gracefully handle the “missing data” case.
    

---

# Why this matters:

- **User experience:** Visitors get a proper 404 page instead of a broken app or cryptic error.
    
- **Performance:** You can serve dynamic pages for unknown IDs, but safely handle missing data.
    
- **Developer sanity:** No need to add complicated error handling in your components—Next.js handles 404 pages cleanly.

# Final notes:

- This pattern is essential when you use fallback modes (`true` or `'blocking'`) with dynamic routes and expect your data source to be potentially incomplete or evolving.
    
- For `fallback: false`, this isn’t needed because Next.js only builds pages for known paths and will 404 unknown ones automatically.
    
- You decide which fallback mode fits your app best — quick load + fallback UI (`true`), waiting for full page (`blocking`), or no fallback (`false`).
