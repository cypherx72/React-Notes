#### 🔁 **Standard React Rendering (Client-Side Rendering - CSR)**

- React apps typically send back **empty HTML** (`<div id="root"></div>`) with JavaScript bundled.
    
- Once the JS runs on the browser, the DOM is built and data is fetched **on the client**.
    
- ❌ **Disadvantages**:
    
    - **Poor SEO**: Search engines see no meaningful content in the initial HTML.
        
    - **Slower User Experience**: Users wait for JS to run + data to load before seeing content.
        
    - Works well for **dashboards** or **auth-gated apps**, but not for **content-heavy** or **public** pages.

#### ⚙️ **Next.js Solution: Pre-rendering**

- Next.js **pre-generates HTML** on the server with required data **before** sending it to the client.
    
- This allows for a **fully populated HTML page** to be sent immediately.
    

---

#### 💡 **Hydration**

- After pre-rendered HTML is loaded, Next.js loads the associated JS bundle.
    
- React takes over and "hydrates" the page — activating interactivity like:
    
    - Forms & validation
        
    - Button clicks
        
    - Dynamic behavior
        

---

#### ✅ **Advantages of Pre-rendering**

- 🔍 **SEO Friendly**: Search engines see full HTML with content.
    
- ⚡ **Improved Performance**: Faster perceived load time — content appears instantly.
    
- 🧠 **Better UX**: Avoids long spinners or empty pages during initial load.
    

---

#### 🔀 **Lifecycle of a Next.js Page**

1. **Initial Load**: Pre-rendered HTML is served.
    
2. **Hydration**: React binds events, activates interactivity.
    
3. **Navigation (SPA)**: Subsequent page changes behave like a single-page app using React routing (client-side transitions).
    

---

### 🔄 **Two Types of Pre-rendering in Next.js**

|Type|When Pages Are Generated|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|**Static Generation (SSG)**|At build time|✅ Best for static content (e.g., blogs, docs)|
|**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**|On every request|✅ Best for dynamic, user-specific or real-time content (e.g., dashboards)|

- Next.js supports **mixing both** methods depending on your route/page needs.
    

---

### 🧠 Takeaway

Pre-rendering bridges the gap between static site speed and React interactivity. It’s one of the **main reasons to choose Next.js** over traditional CRA (Create React App).

---

### 🏗️ **Static Generation (getStaticProps) in Next.js**

---

#### 💡 **Core Idea**

- Static Generation (SSG) means:
    
    - HTML **and** required data are **pre-generated at build time**.
        
    - This allows pages to be **cached** and **served instantly** to users.
        
    - It’s **faster**, **more SEO-friendly**, and **cheaper to scale** (especially with CDNs).
        

---

#### 🛠️ **When Does Static Generation Happen?**

- During the **build process** (`next build`), **before** deployment.
    
- Code executed during this phase behaves like **server-side code**:
    
    - You can access the file system, connect to databases, call APIs, etc.
        
    - No access to browser-specific objects like `window`, `document`, etc.
        

---

#### 📦 **Hydration Still Happens**

- After serving the pre-built HTML, React hydrates the page:
    
    - All interactivity (forms, clicks, state changes) still works like a normal React app.
        
    - You get both **fast initial load** and **React-powered UI** after hydration.
        

---

### 🧩 **How Do We Use Static Generation?**

#### ✅ Use `getStaticProps`

- A **special async function** exported **only inside files under the `pages/` directory**.
    
- Syntax:
    
    ```js
    export async function getStaticProps(context) {
      // Fetch data here (e.g., from DB, file system, or API)
      return {
        props: {
          // Passed as props to the page component
        }
      };
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 🛡️ **Why It’s Secure**

- Code inside `getStaticProps` **never ends up in the client bundle**.
    
- Ideal for server-sensitive logic (e.g., accessing a database with secret credentials).
    

---

### ⚡ **Performance & Caching**

- Once built, static pages can be:
    
    - **Cached by CDNs**
        
    - Served immediately for every request
        
- You essentially get **zero-runtime overhead** on the server for those pages.
    

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Use `getStaticProps` for **content that doesn't change per request**.
    
- Perfect for:
    
    - Blogs, documentation, product pages
        
    - Marketing sites
        
- Avoid it for pages that need user-specific or highly dynamic data — use SSR (`getServerSideProps`) instead.

#### Understanding of **Static Generation in Next.js**, especially focusing on **default pre-rendering** and the setup before using `getStaticProps`.

---

### 🧪 **Next.js Pre-Rendering in Action – Before `getStaticProps`**

---

#### 🧱 **Initial Project Setup**

- A **basic Next.js app** is initialized.
    
- Inside `/pages/index.js`, a hard-coded list is rendered:
    
    ```jsx
    <ul>
      <li>Product One</li>
      <li>Product Two</li>
      <li>Product Three</li>
    </ul>
    ```
    
- Running:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    

---

### 🔍 **View Page Source vs React SPA**

#### 🧾 What’s Visible in the Page Source?

- Viewing the **page source** in the browser reveals:
    
    - Full HTML content is **present at load time**.
        
    - The `<ul>` and `<li>` elements are already rendered in the HTML response.
        

#### 🕵️ Why This Matters?

- Unlike a traditional React app (CRA), which sends a nearly **empty HTML shell** and fills in content **after hydration**,  
    **Next.js pre-renders** even hardcoded pages **by default**.
    

---

### 🧠 **Important Observations**

1. ✅ **No `getStaticProps` is needed yet**:
    
    - Because the data is static and hardcoded.
        
    - Next.js **automatically pre-renders** any page without dynamic data.
        
2. 🔍 **Great for SEO**:
    
    - Content is visible to **search engines** immediately.
        
    - Users get **instant content** without waiting for client-side JavaScript execution.
        
3. 🧠 **Fundamental Insight**:
    
    - Pre-rendering ≠ `getStaticProps` —  
        Even without `getStaticProps`, **static pages are pre-rendered** by default if there's **no dynamic data** involved.
        

---

### 🚀 Next Step: Introducing `getStaticProps`

- Now that the foundation is set, the next focus will be on:
    
    - Replacing **hardcoded data** with **dynamic data fetched at build time** using `getStaticProps`.
