## 🔍 **Why You Might Write Your Own Data Fetching Code**

- **Full control** over state management and the fetch process.
    
- **Custom logic** for handling edge cases, transformations, error states, etc.
    

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('your-url');
    const data = await response.json();
    setData(data);
  }
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

Nothing wrong with this—especially if you want to learn or implement specific logic.

## ⚙️ **But Why Use `useSWR`?**

> It's about **convenience, abstraction, and built-in features** that save you from boilerplate code.

### ✅ Key Features:

- **Caching**
    
- **Automatic Revalidation**
    
- **Retry on error**
    
- **Focus revalidation** (e.g., refetch on tab focus)
    
- **Bundled requests** (if sent in a short timeframe)
    

---

## 🔠 **SWR = Stale-While-Revalidate**

This is a caching strategy:

- Show cached (stale) data immediately.
    
- Revalidate in the background and update the UI with the latest data silently.
    

---

## 🚀 **How to Use SWR in Your Project**

### 1. **Install SWR**

```bash
npm install swr
```

### 2. **Use it in a Component**

```jsx
import useSWR from 'swr';

const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/sales');
```

That’s it—if you're fine with `fetch()` as your default fetcher.

---

## 📥 **Custom Fetcher**

If you need to transform or validate data:

```jsx
const fetcher = url => fetch(url).then(res => res.json());
const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/sales', fetcher);
```

---

## 🔁 **Transforming Data Post-Fetch**

If Firebase returns data in an undesired format (e.g., nested JSON):

- Use a `useEffect` to transform the data **after it's fetched**, not during.
    

```jsx
const [sales, setSales] = useState([]);

useEffect(() => {
  if (data) {
    const transformed = Object.entries(data).map(([id, sale]) => ({
      id,
      username: sale.username,
      volume: sale.volume,
    }));
    setSales(transformed);
  }
}, [data]);
```

---

## 🧠 **Handling States in Render**

```jsx
if (error) return <p>Failed to load</p>;
if (!data || !sales) return <p>Loading...</p>;

return <SalesList sales={sales} />;
```

> Prioritize error before loading. Even if `data` exists, `sales` (the transformed version) might not be ready.

---

## 🧩 **How It Affects Server-Side Rendering**

- SWR is **client-side** only. So:
    
    - First render shows `Loading...`.
        
    - Fetched data is not in the initial HTML (`view page source` won't show the data).
        
    - Use SWR only if SSR or SEO isn't a concern **for that specific data**.
        

---

## 🔚 **Final Thoughts**

- **SWR is not required.** You can always roll your own solution.
    
- But it offers **powerful utilities** out of the box, especially when you need:
    
    - Caching
        
    - Auto revalidation
        
    - Simplified async handling
        
- SWR is a solid middle ground before jumping to heavier solutions like **React Query**.

This transcript explains a **hybrid data fetching strategy** in Next.js: combining **server-side pre-rendering** (via `getStaticProps`) with **client-side data fetching** (via `SWR` or `useEffect + fetch`). This pattern is incredibly useful in real-world apps where:

- You want the user to see initial data immediately (even before JavaScript loads).
    
- You want to **update that data on the client** to ensure it's fresh.
    

Let’s break down the key points and lessons from the transcript:

---

### ✅ **Why Combine `getStaticProps` with Client-Side Fetching?**

- To **pre-render** a static snapshot of data at build time or with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration).
    
- Then on the client side, **fetch the most up-to-date data** (e.g., from an API or database).
    
- This gives the best of both worlds:
    
    - Faster initial page load (SEO-optimized, fast-first paint).
        
    - Fresh data after hydration.
        

---

### 🧱 **How It's Done: Step-by-Step**

#### 1. **Define `getStaticProps`**

- This function runs at **build time** (or during ISR) and returns props to the component.
    
- In this case, it fetches sales data (via `fetch`) and returns it inside a `props` object:
    
    ```js
    export async function getStaticProps() {
      const response = await fetch('https://your-api/sales.json');
      const data = await response.json();
      
      const transformedSales = [];
      for (const key in data) {
        transformedSales.push({
          id: key,
          username: data[key].username,
          volume: data[key].volume,
        });
      }
    
      return {
        props: {
          sales: transformedSales
        },
        revalidate: 10, // ISR: re-fetch this data every 10 seconds
      };
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 2. **Use the Props as Initial State**

In the component (e.g., `LastSalesPage.js`):

```js
const [sales, setSales] = useState(props.sales);
```

This **initializes state** with pre-rendered data, giving the user immediate content.

---

#### 3. **Update the Data Using Client-Side Fetching**

Either with SWR:

```js
const { data, error } = useSWR('https://your-api/sales.json', fetcher);

useEffect(() => {
  if (data) {
    const transformedSales = [];
    for (const key in data) {
      transformedSales.push({
        id: key,
        username: data[key].username,
        volume: data[key].volume,
      });
    }
    setSales(transformedSales);
  }
}, [data]);
```

Or manually with `useEffect` and `fetch`. Either way, this ensures **updated content is loaded** once the component mounts.

---

### ⚙️ **Behavior Summary**

|Step|What Happens?|
|---|---|
|Build Time|`getStaticProps` runs. Static HTML is generated using `props.sales`.|
|Page Load|Browser shows the **pre-rendered HTML** instantly.|
|Hydration|React takes over. Client-side fetch (`SWR` or `fetch`) kicks in.|
|Updated State|If server data has changed, new data is fetched and **state is updated**, causing a re-render.|

---

### 📄 **Important Notes**

- During dev (`npm run dev`), `getStaticProps` runs on **every request**, not just build.
    
- In prod (`npm run build` + `npm start`):
    
    - With `revalidate: 10`, data is re-fetched every 10 seconds _after_ the first request.
        
    - Without `revalidate`, data is **never updated** unless you rebuild.
        

---

### 🧪 **Demo Observation (Julie’s Sale)**

- Page source shows **pre-rendered sales**, not including Julie (added after build).
    
- On page load, SWR kicks in and **fetches updated data**, so Julie **appears in the UI**.
    
- But she’s not in the `View Page Source` HTML — because she wasn’t there at build time.
    

---

### 🔥 Why This Matters

This hybrid approach is excellent for:

- **SEO-optimized pages** that still need live updates.
    
- **News feeds**, **ecommerce listings**, **dashboard data**, etc.
    
- Avoiding loading spinners and improving **first paint experience**.
    

---

### 🧠 Takeaway

> Pre-render a "snapshot" to get fast, SEO-friendly HTML. Then fetch the live data in the browser to ensure freshness. This hybrid strategy is powerful and necessary in many real-world apps.
