### The core difference:

**React Router (traditional React apps)** requires you to manually define routes in your React code, using `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, and so on — meaning your routes are explicit, declarative JSX components inside your app.

**Next.js Pages Router** drops all that routing JSX and instead does _file-system based routing._ You simply create React component files in a `pages/` directory, and Next.js infers your app’s route structure from the folder and file names.

---

### How the Pages Router works (simplified):

- `pages/index.js` → maps to `/` (root path)
    
- `pages/about.js` → maps to `/about`
    
- `pages/products/index.js` → maps to `/products`
    
- `pages/products/[id].js` → maps to `/products/:id` (dynamic route)
    

---

### Why is this better?

- **No route config code needed.** Just create files and folders, Next.js handles the routing for you.
    
- **Cleaner, more predictable project structure.** Your routes are visible in your folder tree.
    
- **Dynamic routes are super simple:** Just wrap the parameter name in square brackets — e.g., `[id].js` — and Next.js automatically maps `/products/123`, `/products/abc`, etc., to that page component, where you can access the `id` param.
    
- **Built-in code splitting:** Next.js automatically splits your app by routes based on files, improving performance.

### How this replaces React Router setup

Instead of:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
    <Route path="/products/:id" element={<ProductDetailPage />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

You just create:

```
pages/
  index.js           // HomePage component
  about.js           // AboutPage component
  products/
    index.js         // Products listing page
    [id].js          // Product detail page for dynamic product ID
```

And Next.js handles all the routing magically.

---

### One quick note on `index.js`

- Files named `index.js` always map to the _root_ of the folder’s path.
    
- So `pages/index.js` → `/`
    
- `pages/products/index.js` → `/products`
    

This is why `index.js` files are special—they represent the folder’s base route.

---

### Wrapping up

This approach is way less error-prone and more intuitive, especially as your app grows.

Once you’re comfortable with this, you’ll appreciate how Next.js simplifies routing — no need to maintain route configs or worry about matching paths manually.
