### 🎯 **Goal of This Section**

To **enhance SEO and user experience** by setting **custom metadata (like `<title>` and `<meta>` tags)** for your Next.js pages using the built-in `Head` component.

---

### 📦 **Project Setup**

- You're working with the **events project** from earlier.
    
- Before proceeding:
    
    - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
        
    - Start the dev server: `npm run dev`.
        

---

### 🔍 **Problem Identified**

- When inspecting the **`<head>` tag** in the browser:
    
    - It's **mostly empty**.
        
    - No `<title>` or `<meta name="description">`.
        
    - Only contains autogenerated style/script links from Next.js.
        

---

### ⚠️ **Why This Is a Problem**

- **User Experience:**
    
    - No **tab title** in the browser.
        
- **SEO:**
    
    - **Search engines** like Google rely on:
        
        - `<title>` for page labeling.
            
        - `<meta description>` for summaries in search results.

### ✅ **Next.js Solution**

Use the built-in `<Head>` component from `next/head` to inject custom tags into the document head **on a per-page basis**.

---

### 🧠 **How This Works**

You can import the `Head` component and include it in your React components:

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Event Listing | My Events App</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Browse exciting events happening in your area!" />
      </Head>
      <main>
        {/* page content */}
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```

---

### 🛠️ **What You'll Likely Do Next**

- Update each page (like `pages/index.js`, `pages/events.js`, etc.) to:
    
    - Add a relevant `<title>`.
        
    - Add a unique `<meta name="description">`.
        

---

### 🚀 **Benefits**

- Browser tabs display useful labels.
    
- Better previews in social shares and search engine results.
    
- Helps with SEO and crawlability.
