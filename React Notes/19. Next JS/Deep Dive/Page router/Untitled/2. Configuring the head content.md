### How to Add Custom Metadata in Next.js with `<Head>`

---

### 1. **Import the Head component**

Next.js provides a special React component called `Head` from the `next/head` package:

```js
import Head from 'next/head';
```

- Important: It’s **`Head` with a capital H**, not lowercase.
    
- You can import it anywhere inside your page or component files.
    

---

### 2. **Use `<Head>` anywhere in your JSX**

You can place `<Head>` inside your page components, even nested inside JSX, and anything inside will be injected into the HTML `<head>` tag when the page renders.

Example inside `pages/index.js`:

```jsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Next.js Events</title>
        <meta
          name="description"
          content="Find a lot of great events that allow you to evolve..."
        />
      </Head>
      <main>
        {/* your page content */}
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```

---

### 3. **What can you add inside `<Head>`?**

You can add any **valid HTML elements for the head**, such as:

- `<title>` — defines the browser tab title
    
- `<meta>` tags — for description, keywords, viewport, charset, social media tags, etc.
    
- `<link>` — for favicons, fonts, or stylesheets
    
- `<script>` — for any extra scripts you want in the head
    

---

### 4. **Why bother?**

- **Better SEO:** Search engines rely on the title and meta description to rank and display your page.
    
- **User experience:** The tab title shows context to users.
    
- **Control:** You can customize metadata on a per-page basis, not just globally.
    

---

### 5. **How does Next.js handle it?**

When your component renders, Next.js **injects the contents of all `<Head>` components found on the page into the real `<head>`** section of the HTML output.

---

### 6. **Practical tip:**

- Always use `<Head>` to add page-specific metadata.
    
- Don’t try to add metadata directly in your layout or global components if it varies by page.
    
- Combine this with dynamic data if needed (e.g., event titles/descriptions).
    

---

### Bottom line:

This is the **standard, clean, React-friendly way to control your page’s head content** in Next.js. Master this early—it’s essential for SEO, accessibility, and overall app polish.

---
## Adding dynamic head content
### 1. **Dynamic Metadata for Different Pages**

- You’re not just setting a static `<title>` or `<meta>` description on the homepage.
    
- Each page should have **context-relevant metadata**:
    
    - `All Events` page: static title, static description (or customized).
        
    - Single event page: dynamic title and description pulled from the event data (`event.title`, `event.description`).
        
    - Filtered events page (e.g., by month/year): dynamic title and description using URL params or state (`numMonth`, `numYear`).
        

**Why?**  
This improves SEO massively because each page is uniquely identifiable and relevant to what users (and search engines) want to see.

---

### 2. **Use `<Head>` inside your page components**

You can freely import and use `Head` from `next/head` inside each page component.

Example for single event page:

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';

function EventPage({ event }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{event.title}</title>
        <meta name="description" content={event.description} />
      </Head>
      {/* page content */}
    </>
  );
}
```

This works because your metadata is dynamic, coming from your data fetching or props.

---

### 3. **Handle edge cases (loading/error states) with metadata too**

- If your page can show different UI states like loading, error, or no data, **you should also add `<Head>` in those branches**.
    
- Otherwise, the page metadata may be missing or wrong when those states are shown.
    
- This is crucial because otherwise:
    
    - The page source served by the server might miss metadata.
        
    - Search engines could see incorrect or no metadata.
        

Example:

```jsx
if (loading) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Loading event...</title>
      </Head>
      <p>Loading...</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

---

### 4. **Metadata appears both on client and server**

- Metadata added with `<Head>` is included in the **server-rendered HTML**.
    
- This means SEO crawlers see the correct metadata **right away**, not just after JavaScript hydration.
    
- Inspecting the **page source** (not just devtools elements tab) will confirm this.
    

---

### 5. **Avoid copy-pasting metadata on every page**

- You _can_ add the same `<Head>` tags everywhere but that’s inefficient and error-prone.
    
- Next.js offers ways to **reuse head metadata globally or share logic**:
    
    - Custom `_app.js` or `_document.js` (for global metadata)
        
    - Layout components wrapping pages with default metadata
        
    - Utility functions or components that generate metadata dynamically
        

---

### **Next step (forward-thinking advice):**

- Define a **shared Layout component** that includes default metadata.
    
- Allow pages to override or append to that metadata with their own `<Head>`.
    
- For dynamic metadata, pass data down to your Layout or metadata components.
    
- For error/loading states, build metadata handling into your page’s rendering logic.

If you want, I can help you design a scalable metadata strategy for your events project that:

- Avoids repetition
    
- Handles dynamic and static metadata gracefully
    
- Works with server-side rendering perfectly

### Core Idea: **Reusable Head Metadata in a Component with Multiple Return Paths**

When you have different UI branches (if checks), you want consistent metadata (title, description) reused across all branches without copy-pasting the same `<Head>` block everywhere.

---

### How to do it — the React way:

1. **Create a variable (e.g., `pageHeadData`) holding your `<Head>` JSX.**  
    This variable will store the metadata JSX dynamically, based on your component’s state or props.
    
2. **Define or update this variable before any of your `return` statements.**  
    Usually, you build this after you have your data ready or at least after your loading/error checks, so you can set dynamic titles/descriptions correctly.
    
3. **Insert `pageHeadData` in every return branch.**  
    Since it's a JSX element stored in a variable, you just include `{pageHeadData}` in the returned JSX fragment for each branch.
    

---

### What to watch out for:

- **Data may be undefined initially** because Next.js routing params (like slug or query) aren't available on first render.  
    So your data-dependent metadata has to be set _after_ you confirm data presence (e.g., after a loading check).
    
- **Use `let` instead of `const` if you want to reassign your `pageHeadData` variable** as your data or state changes during rendering.
    

---

### Example pattern (simplified):

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';

function FilteredEventsPage({ filteredEvents, numMonth, numYear }) {
  let pageHeadData = (
    <Head>
      <title>Filtered Events</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Loading events..." />
    </Head>
  );

  if (!filteredEvents) {
    return (
      <>
        {pageHeadData}
        <p>Loading...</p>
      </>
    );
  }

  if (filteredEvents.length === 0) {
    pageHeadData = (
      <Head>
        <title>No Events Found</title>
        <meta name="description" content={`No events found for ${numMonth}/${numYear}`} />
      </Head>
    );
    return (
      <>
        {pageHeadData}
        <p>No events for your filter.</p>
      </>
    );
  }

  pageHeadData = (
    <Head>
      <title>Events for {numMonth}/{numYear}</title>
      <meta name="description" content={`All events for ${numMonth}/${numYear}`} />
    </Head>
  );

  return (
    <>
      {pageHeadData}
      {/* Render events */}
    </>
  );
}
```

---

### Why this matters — no sugar-coating:

- **Avoids redundant code and copy-pasting.** That’s a productivity killer and error-prone.
    
- **Keeps your metadata consistent across all UI states**, which is critical for SEO and UX.
    
- **Prepares your app for SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** properly by making sure the head content is included regardless of UI state.
    
- **Keeps your code clean, readable, and maintainable.**
    

---

### Forward-thinking advice:

- For bigger apps, this can get verbose if repeated often. Think about **abstracting head logic into reusable hooks or helper components** to centralize metadata management.
    
- Consider using libraries like [`next-seo`](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) if your project scales — they provide declarative, centralized SEO management with fallback defaults, dynamic metadata, and easy overrides.
    
- Always test your metadata with tools like [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) or [Lighthouse SEO audits](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) to ensure your dynamic head tags are working as expected.
