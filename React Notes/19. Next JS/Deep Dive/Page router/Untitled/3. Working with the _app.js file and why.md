You’re exactly hitting one of Next.js’s core strengths here: **global page settings without repetitive code**. This is how you efficiently manage stuff like meta tags or components that should wrap _every single page_ without copy-pasting.

### Here’s the lowdown on `_app.js` and global Head management:

- **`_app.js` is the root React component that Next.js uses to render _every_ page.**  
    The actual page component you want to show gets passed in as a prop (`Component`) inside `_app.js`.
    
- You’re already using `_app.js` to wrap every page with a common layout (navigation, footer, etc.).  
    This is the **perfect place** to put global Head tags that should appear on _all pages_, like:
    
    - viewport meta for responsiveness (`<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />`)
        
    - favicon links
        
    - default charset
        
    - maybe some global SEO tags or fonts
        
- By importing `Head` from `next/head` and including your shared `<Head>` content in `_app.js`, **you guarantee it’s injected into every page’s `<head>` section automatically.**  
    No need to repeat this on every single page component.

### Why this matters — no fluff:

- This is the **only place you need to set truly global `<head>` info.**  
    If you try to set viewport tags or default metadata inside individual pages, you risk inconsistent or duplicated data.
    
- This keeps your codebase DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and easy to maintain.  
    Change your global viewport or font just once, and it applies everywhere.
    
- It’s fully compatible with dynamic, per-page `<Head>` content. The per-page `<Head>` merges with the global one from `_app.js`.  
    So you can have default meta _plus_ page-specific meta (like event titles or descriptions).

### Quick example snippet for `_app.js`:

```jsx
// pages/_app.js
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
        {/* Add favicon, default charset, or global SEO tags here */}
      </Head>
      {/* Wrap all pages with common layout */}
      <Layout>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Layout>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Pro tip — Next step in scalability:

If your project grows, you might want to:

- Abstract your global `<Head>` content into its own component (e.g., `<GlobalHead />`) and import that into `_app.js`.
    
- Use libraries like **next-seo** for declarative, centralized SEO and meta tag management.
    
- Set up a **default meta template** that can be extended or overridden on a per-page basis.

In short, you’re on the right track — use `_app.js` for global Head settings, and individual pages for dynamic, page-specific Head data. This pattern is **clean, scalable, and efficient**.
