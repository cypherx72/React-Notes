## Next.js API Routes

- **API Routes** = Server-side functions in `pages/api/*` folder.
    
- These act like Express.js endpoints and allow backend code within your Next.js app.
    

### Setup:

- Create a `pages/api` folder.
    
- Add files like `new-meetup.js`. These map to `/api/new-meetup`.
    

```js
// pages/api/new-meetup.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    const { title, image, address, description } = req.body;
    // Store this data in a database
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Meetup created' });
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method Not Allowed' });
  }
}
```

### Key Points:

- Runs **only on the server**. Never exposed to the client.
    
- Safe to include sensitive code (like DB credentials).
    
- Handles different HTTP methods (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, etc.).
    
- Use `req.body` to get submitted JSON data.

### MongoDB Atlas Setup and Integration with Next.js API

#### 🛠️ Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas

- Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and click **Try Free**.
    
- Sign up and create an account.
    
- You’ll be taken to a **cluster creation wizard**.
    
- **Choose Free Tier (M0 Sandbox)**:
    
    - Provider: AWS (default)
        
    - Region: Default (or closest to you)
        
    - Leave all other settings as default.
        

#### 🌐 Configure Network & Database Access

- **Network Access**:
    
    - Add your IP using `Add IP Address` → `Current IP`.
        
- **Database Access**:
    
    - Create a user with **read and write access**.
        

#### 📡 Connecting to the Cluster

- Go to **Clusters** → **Connect** → **Connect your application**.
    
- Select **Node.js Driver** and copy the connection string.
    

#### 📦 Installing MongoDB Driver

```bash
npm install mongodb
```

#### 🔌 Using MongoDB in API Route (Next.js)

- Use the MongoDB client to connect:
    

```js
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    const data = req.body;

    const client = await MongoClient.connect(
      "mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@cluster.mongodb.net/<DB_NAME>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
    );
    const db = client.db(); // Defaults to DB_NAME
    const meetupsCollection = db.collection("meetups");

    const result = await meetupsCollection.insertOne(data);
    console.log(result);

    client.close();

    res.status(201).json({ message: "Meetup inserted!" });
  }
}

export default handler;
```

> ⚠️ **NEVER run this code on the client side.** Your DB credentials must stay secure—only API routes or server-side functions should contain this logic.

#### 📘 Notes on MongoDB Structure

- **Database**: Created automatically if it doesn’t exist.
    
- **Collection**: Similar to tables in SQL.
    
- **Document**: A JavaScript object (like a row in SQL).
    
    - e.g., one meetup = one document
        

#### 📎 Optional: Error Handling

- Wrap DB connection and insertion in a `try-catch` block if needed.
    

## `Handling API Requests in New Meetup Page (Next.js)`

---

### **Context**

- We are working with the `NewMeetupForm` component in a Next.js app.
    
- On form submission, data is passed to a handler function (`addMeetupHandler`) in the `new-meetup` page.
    
- This data is sent to an internal API route (`/api/new-meetup`) to be stored in MongoDB.
    

---

### **Steps to Handle API Requests**

#### ✅ **1. Call Handler from `NewMeetupForm`**

- `props.onAddMeetup(enteredMeetupData)` is used in the form component.
    

#### ✅ **2. Define Handler in `pages/new-meetup/index.js`**

- This handler receives `enteredMeetupData` and is responsible for sending it to the backend API.
    

#### ✅ **3. Send Data to API using `fetch()`**

```js
async function addMeetupHandler(enteredMeetupData) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/new-meetup', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(enteredMeetupData),
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data); // optional logging
}
```

- Path `/api/new-meetup` refers to the file `pages/api/new-meetup.js`.
    
- The fetch method is used with:
    
    - `method: 'POST'`
        
    - `body`: stringified JSON of the meetup data
        
    - `headers`: indicating `application/json`
        

---

### **4. MongoDB Integration Notes**

- Ensure MongoDB:
    
    - Whitelists your local IP
        
    - Has valid credentials set up in `.env.local`
        
- After successful request, MongoDB should show:
    
    - Database: `meetups`
        
    - Collection: `meetups`
        
    - Document with generated `_id` and submitted data
        

---

### **5. Redirect After Submission**

- Use the `useRouter()` hook from `next/router`.
    

```js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const router = useRouter();
// After successful submission
router.push('/'); // or router.replace('/') if you want to prevent back nav
```

---

### ✅ Optional Enhancements (Not Next.js specific)

- Show a loading spinner while the request is sent
    
- Handle errors gracefully
    
- Validate user input before submission
    

---

### ✅ **What's the Problem?**

Your app is storing meetups in MongoDB, **but you're still displaying dummy data** on the frontend. That’s a disconnect—you’re not using the actual data you've saved.

---

### 🔄 **How to Fix It?**

You need to **fetch data from MongoDB** and use it in your components. There are two main ways to fetch data server-side in Next.js:

1. `getStaticProps` (for static generation with revalidation)
    
2. `getServerSideProps` (for server-side rendering on every request)
    

---

### ❌ **Avoid This Common Mistake**

> Sending a `fetch()` request from `getStaticProps` to your **own** API route (`/api/meetups`) is **redundant**.  
> You're already on the server! Just directly call your DB from `getStaticProps`.

---

### ✅ **Best Practice**

**Directly access MongoDB from `getStaticProps`**:

```js
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const client = await MongoClient.connect('your-mongodb-uri');
  const db = client.db();
  const meetupsCollection = db.collection('meetups');

  const meetups = await meetupsCollection.find().toArray();
  client.close();

  return {
    props: {
      meetups: meetups.map(meetup => ({
        title: meetup.title,
        address: meetup.address,
        image: meetup.image,
        id: meetup._id.toString(),  // <- converting MongoDB ObjectId to string
      })),
    },
    revalidate: 10, // ISR: re-generates the page every 10 seconds (optional)
  };
}
```

---

### 💡 **Why Not Use API Routes Here?**

- `getStaticProps` runs **only on the server**, never in the browser.
    
- Code here is **secure** and not exposed to the client.
    
- Using API routes adds unnecessary overhead (an internal HTTP request).
    

---

### 🔐 **Bonus: Importing MongoClient Safely**

When you import `MongoClient` into a page and only use it inside `getStaticProps`, **Next.js won't include it in the client bundle**. This keeps your frontend **lean and secure**.

---

### 🛠 Error: MongoDB `_id` Issue

MongoDB returns `_id` as an `ObjectId`, which cannot be serialized directly. You must:

```js
id: meetup._id.toString()
```

If you don’t, Next.js will throw a serialization error.

---

### ✅ Final Outcome

- You’ve connected the database to your frontend.
    
- Your meetups list now dynamically reflects your DB contents.
    
- Dummy data is officially dead. 🎉

### 🧠 Topic: `getStaticPaths`, `getStaticProps`, and Dynamic Pages with MongoDB in Next.js

---

### 🗂️ Folder: `pages/meetups/[meetupId].js`

---

### ✅ Summary:

In this section, you're learning how to **dynamically pre-generate pages** in a Next.js app using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`, and how to **securely connect to MongoDB** server-side.

---

### 🔑 Key Concepts:

#### 1. **Server-Side Code in `getStaticProps`**

- Only runs on the **server at build time**.
    
- Code is **never included in the client bundle**.
    
- Safe to use **credentials**, like MongoDB connection strings.
    

#### 2. **Dynamic Routes with `getStaticPaths`**

- Used to tell Next.js **which paths to pre-generate**.
    
- Example: if your route is `/meetups/[meetupId]`, you must return:
    

```js
paths: [
  { params: { meetupId: 'abc123' } },
  { params: { meetupId: 'xyz456' } }
],
fallback: false
```

#### 3. **Connecting to MongoDB**

- You connect like this:
    

```js
import { MongoClient, ObjectId } from 'mongodb';

const client = await MongoClient.connect(MONGO_URL);
const db = client.db();
const meetupsCollection = db.collection('meetups');
```

- Fetch all meetup IDs:
    

```js
const meetups = await meetupsCollection
  .find({}, { projection: { _id: 1 } })
  .toArray();
```

- Convert each to string for the path:
    

```js
paths: meetups.map(meetup => ({
  params: { meetupId: meetup._id.toString() }
}))
```

#### 4. **Fetch Single Meetup in `getStaticProps`**

```js
const meetupId = context.params.meetupId;

const selectedMeetup = await meetupsCollection.findOne({
  _id: new ObjectId(meetupId)
});
```

Then shape the returned object for the frontend:

```js
return {
  props: {
    meetupData: {
      id: selectedMeetup._id.toString(),
      title: selectedMeetup.title,
      image: selectedMeetup.image,
      address: selectedMeetup.address,
      description: selectedMeetup.description
    }
  }
};
```

---

### 📌 JSX Integration

Make sure your `MeetupDetail` component uses the actual fetched props:

```jsx
<MeetupDetail
  image={props.meetupData.image}
  title={props.meetupData.title}
  address={props.meetupData.address}
  description={props.meetupData.description}
/>
```

---

### 🔁 Refactoring Tip

You can extract the MongoDB connection logic to a helper like `helpers/db.js`:

```js
export async function connectDatabase() {
  const client = await MongoClient.connect(MONGO_URL);
  return client;
}
```

Then import and reuse it in both `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`.

---

### 🚀 Final Result:

- All meetup detail pages are **pre-generated at build time**.
    
- Only **valid meetup IDs** are supported (based on your MongoDB).
    
- Pages load **instantly**, with **full SEO benefits**.
    
- No **client-side DB access or credential leakage**.
    

---

### Page Metadata and SEO with `next/head`

**Overview:**  
Before deploying a Next.js application, it's important to add metadata to improve SEO and the overall user experience. This includes setting the `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` for each page using the built-in `Head` component from `next/head`.

---

#### ✅ Why Add Metadata?

- Improves visibility on search engines (SEO)
    
- Sets meaningful tab titles for a better UX
    
- Provides search engines with content previews via description meta tags
    

---

#### 🔧 How to Use `Head` in Next.js

1. **Import `Head` and `Fragment`:**
    
    ```js
    import Head from 'next/head'
    import { Fragment } from 'react'
    ```
    
2. **Wrap the page JSX with `Fragment` and include the `Head` component:**
    
    ```js
    return (
      <Fragment>
        <Head>
          <title>React Meetups</title>
          <meta name="description" content="Browse a huge list of highly active React meetups." />
        </Head>
        <MeetupList meetups={props.meetups} />
      </Fragment>
    )
    ```
    

---

#### 🧠 Metadata for Different Pages

**1. `pages/index.js` (Home Page)**

```js
<Head>
  <title>React Meetups</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Browse a huge list of highly active React meetups." />
</Head>
```

**2. `pages/new-meetup/index.js` (New Meetup Form Page)**

```js
<Head>
  <title>Add a New Meetup</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Add your own meetups. Create amazing networking opportunities." />
</Head>
```

**3. `pages/[meetupId]/index.js` (Single Meetup Detail Page)**

```js
<Head>
  <title>{props.meetupData.title}</title>
  <meta name="description" content={props.meetupData.description} />
</Head>
```

- Use dynamic metadata based on fetched `meetupData` props.
    
- This improves SEO by making each page’s metadata unique.
    

---

#### 💡 Notes

- All head elements added with `next/head` will be injected into the `<head>` section of the rendered HTML.
    
- Dynamic values like `props.meetupData.title` or `description` are supported and fully functional.
    
- Adding metadata is not required for functionality, but essential for production-ready deployment.
    

---

**✅ Final Step Before Deployment:**  
With metadata added, the app is now SEO-friendly and ready for deployment. Next step is deploying it to a platform like **Vercel**.
