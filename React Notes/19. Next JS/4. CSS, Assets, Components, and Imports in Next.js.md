### ✅ 1. **Global Styles with `globals.css`**

- Located in the `/app` directory.
    
- Imported **once** in the **root `layout.js`**:
    
    ```js
    import './globals.css';
    ```
    
- This makes the styles globally available across all pages.
    
- Works similarly to how CSS is imported in Vanilla React.

### ✅ 2. **Favicon with `icon.png`**

- Add a file named `icon.png` inside the `/app` directory.
    
- This file is automatically used as the **favicon** (browser tab icon).
    
- No need to manually link to it via `<head>` or metadata.

### ✅ 3. **Reserved vs. Regular Files**

|File Type|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`page.js`|Defines a route/page|
|`layout.js`|Layout wrapper for one or more pages|
|`icon.png`|Used automatically as the favicon|
|`globals.css`|Global styles|

- **Custom Components** (like `header.js`) are **not** picked up automatically by Next.js for routing. They're treated as normal React components.

### ✅ 4. **Creating and Using Custom Components**

- Example: A `Header` component moved into its own file:
    
    ```js
    // app/components/header.js
    export default function Header() {
      return (
        <>
          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <img src="/icon.png" alt="Logo" />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```
    
- **Import into `page.js`**:
    
    ```js
    import Header from './components/header'; // if inside app/
    ```
    
- ⚠️ **Only folders with a `page.js` file become routes.**  
    E.g., `/components` won't be available as a route unless `components/page.js` exists.
    

---

### ✅ 5. **Preferred Folder Structure**

Two common approaches:

1. **Store components inside `/app/components`** – good for co-located logic.
    
2. **Store components outside `/app`** – cleaner separation of concerns.
    

> 💡 The speaker prefers keeping components outside `/app` to keep routing logic and UI logic separated.

### ✅ 6. **Using Path Aliases (`@`)**

- You can simplify import paths using `@`:
    
    ```js
    import Header from '@/components/header';
    ```
    
- Set up in **`jsconfig.json`**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": ".",
        "paths": {
          "@/*": ["./*"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
- This resolves `@` to the project root, making imports cleaner and more maintainable.

**Reserved Filenames**

As you already learned, there are some reserved filenames when working with NextJS.

Important: These filenames are only reserved when creating them inside of the `app/` folder (or any subfolder). Outside of the `app/` folder, these filenames are not treated in any special way.

Here's a list of reserved filenames in NextJS -:

- `page.js` => Create a new page (e.g., `app/about/page.js` creates a `<your-domain>/about` page)
    
- `layout.js` => Create a new layout that wraps sibling and nested pages
    
- `not-found.js` => Fallback page for "Not Found" errors (thrown by sibling or nested pages or layouts)
    
- `error.js` => Fallback page for other errors (thrown by sibling pages or nested pages or layouts)
    
- `loading.js` => Fallback page which is shown whilst sibling or nested pages (or layouts) are fetching data
    
- `route.js` => Allows you to create an API route (i.e., a page which does NOT return JSX code but instead data, e.g., in the JSON format)
