## Framer Motion - `useAnimate` Hook (Imperative Animations)

### üß† Overview

- While most Framer Motion animations are **declarative** (`<motion.div>` with `animate`, `initial`, etc.),  
    **`useAnimate` enables imperative animations**, triggered by code (e.g., on form validation failure).
    

---

### üîß `useAnimate` Syntax

```js
const [scope, animate] = useAnimate();
```

- `scope`: a **ref** to bind to the parent element (like a `<form>`), scoping the animation.
    
- `animate`: a **function** used to trigger animations via **CSS selectors**.
    

---

### ü™Ñ Usage Example

```js
animate(
  "input, textarea", // selector for elements to animate
  { x: [-10, 0, 10, 0] }, // animation keyframes (shaking X axis)
  {
    type: "spring",
    duration: 0.2,
    delay: stagger(0.05), // stagger the animation for multiple inputs
  }
);
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Steps

1. **Import hooks**:
    

```js
import { useAnimate, stagger } from "framer-motion";
```

2. **Get scope + animate**:
    

```js
const [scope, animate] = useAnimate();
```

3. **Attach `scope` to a parent container** (e.g., form):
    

```jsx
<form ref={scope} ...>
```

4. **Trigger animation imperatively**:
    

```js
if (formIsInvalid) {
  animate("input, textarea", { x: [-10, 0, 10, 0] }, {
    type: "spring",
    duration: 0.2,
    delay: stagger(0.05)
  });
  return;
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Why Use This?

- Great for **form validation feedback**, like shaking inputs.
    
- Keeps animation **scoped** to a specific section (via `scope` ref).
    
- **Avoids boilerplate** if you only need quick animations on dynamic triggers.
    

---

### üß† Bonus: `stagger()`

- Adds **delays** between each element's animation.
    
- Perfect for **sequential effects** (e.g., shaking inputs one after the other).
    

---

## Framer Motion - `layout` Prop for List & Tab Animations

### üß† Goal

- Animate layout transitions in a **list** or between **tabs** when items are **added, removed, or moved**.
    
- Avoid "snapping" when an item disappears or moves to another tab ‚Äî instead, animate the transition.
    

---

### ü™Ñ Core Concept: `layout` Prop

> Add the `layout` prop to a `motion` component to **animate position/size/layout changes** automatically.

---

### ‚ú® Implementation Steps

1. **Convert your list item to a motion element**:
    

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

<motion.li layout>
  {/* content */}
</motion.li>
```

2. **No additional config is needed** ‚Äî Framer Motion will:
    
    - Detect when a component's position changes
        
    - Animate that movement smoothly
        
    - Handle item reordering and removals visually
        

---

### ‚úÖ Example Use Case

When marking a challenge as "completed" or "failed":

- The item is removed from the current list.
    
- The remaining items **shift upward or downward**.
    
- That shift is **animated**, not instant.
    

```jsx
{
  challenges.map(challenge => (
    <motion.li key={challenge.id} layout>
      {/* Challenge content */}
    </motion.li>
  ))
}
```

---

### üéØ Notes

- `layout` works **only when the element stays in the DOM** (e.g., not completely unmounted immediately).
    
- You should **wrap changing components in `motion` tags** (`motion.li`, `motion.div`, etc.)
    
- Perfect for **tab UIs**, **sortable lists**, and **multi-tab forms**.
    

---

### üîÅ Result

- Without `layout`: Items disappear and remaining ones **jump** to their new positions.
    
- With `layout`: Items **animate** to new positions, creating a smooth, natural UX.

## Framer Motion: List Animations with AnimatePresence

### üß† Goal

Animate both **movement** and **appearance/disappearance** of challenge items in a tabbed list UI using Framer Motion.

---

### ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

#### 1. **Animating Layout Changes in List Items**

- **Convert `<li>` to `motion.li`** in `ChallengeItem.jsx`.
    
- **Add `layout` prop** to enable smooth movement of remaining items when others are removed.
    

```jsx
<motion.li layout>...</motion.li>
```

#### 2. **Animating Item Removal (Exit)**

- In `Challenges.jsx`, **import and wrap** the mapped list in `<AnimatePresence>`.
    
- In `ChallengeItem.jsx`, **add `exit` prop** to animate removed items:
    

```jsx
<motion.li
  layout
  exit={{ y: -30, opacity: 0 }}
>
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: Last Item Disappears Instantly

This happens because:

- The entire list (`<ol>`) is conditionally rendered and removed if `displayedChallenges` is empty.
    
- Framer Motion can‚Äôt animate what gets removed all at once.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Fix for Last Item + "No Challenges" Message

#### 3. **Wrap Both the List and Fallback in AnimatePresence**

```jsx
<AnimatePresence mode="wait">
  {displayedChallenges.length > 0 ? (
    <motion.ol
      key="list"
      exit={{ y: -30, opacity: 0 }}
    >
      ...
    </motion.ol>
  ) : (
    <motion.p
      key="fallback"
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}
    >
      No challenges found
    </motion.p>
  )}
</AnimatePresence>
```

#### Key concepts:

- **Use `key` prop** (`"list"` and `"fallback"`) so Framer Motion can distinguish between elements.
    
- **Set `mode="wait"`** so the fallback text **waits** until the list is fully animated out before appearing.
    

---

### üî• Final Effect

- Smooth animation of items moving.
    
- Exit animations for disappearing items.
    
- Polished transitions between list and fallback text.
    
- Controlled animation sequence using `mode="wait"`.

### ‚úÖ Summary: Fixing Wobbly Layout Animations with Framer Motion in a List

You're tackling a common issue when using `layout` with Framer Motion on list items: **unexpected wobbles or distortions** when expanding/collapsing item details (like descriptions or images). Here's a breakdown of the root cause and fix:

---

### üí• Problem:

When you **expand the details** of an item (e.g. show a description), the `layout` prop on the `motion.li` causes **Framer Motion to animate both position and size (height)**.

This leads to:

- Strange wobbles
    
- Glitchy image distortions
    
- Janky UX
    

---

### üß† Why It Happens:

With `layout` enabled:

- **Any change in height** (like expanding content) **triggers an animation**.
    
- But if Framer Motion doesn't know **how the height is changing**, it animates _everything_ ‚Üí leads to the flickering effect.
    

---

### ‚úÖ The Fix:

Animate **the content that‚Äôs being added or removed** _independently_, so the parent list item doesn‚Äôt suddenly shift in height.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps:

#### 1. **Convert the expandable `<div>` to a `motion.div`**

```jsx
{isExpanded && (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
    animate={{ height: "auto", opacity: 1 }}
    exit={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
    style={{ overflow: "hidden" }}
  >
    {/* Expanded Content */}
  </motion.div>
)}
```

#### 2. **Wrap it with `AnimatePresence`** to enable exit animations:

```jsx
<AnimatePresence>
  {isExpanded && (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ height: "auto", opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
      style={{ overflow: "hidden" }}
    >
      {/* Expanded Content */}
    </motion.div>
  )}
</AnimatePresence>
```

#### 3. **Ensure `AnimatePresence` is imported**:

```js
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from "framer-motion";
```

#### 4. (Optional) **If flickers still happen**, double-check:

- The key on the list item is stable.
    
- You're not conditionally rendering parents abruptly (that bypasses AnimatePresence).
    
- You aren't mixing layout + sudden DOM removals.
    

---

### üéâ Result:

- Smooth expand/collapse of details.
    
- No layout distortion.
    
- Proper control over animations instead of letting layout auto-animate everything.
