### Optimizing Images in NextJS with `<Image />`

Next.js provides a **built-in `Image` component** from `next/image` that replaces the native `<img>` tag for better performance and optimization.

#### ðŸ”¥ Why Use the `Image` Component?

- Automatically lazy loads images (loads only when visible).
    
- Automatically serves **responsive** images using `srcSet`.
    
- **Auto-detects image dimensions** from imported images.
    
- Supports **modern image formats** like WebP (better compression).
    
- Prevents layout shifts during loading.
    
- Great **developer experience** â€” most features work out of the box.

#### âœ… How to Use

1. **Import the image and the component:**
    

```js
import Image from 'next/image';
import logo from './logo.png'; // local image
```

2. **Replace `<img />` with `<Image />`:**
    

```jsx
<Image src={logo} alt="Site Logo" priority />
```

- `src`: Use the **imported image object**, not just a path string.
    
- `alt`: Accessibility support.
    
- `priority`: Ensures the image is loaded eagerly (important for above-the-fold images like logos).

#### ðŸ’¡ Behind the Scenes (What NextJS Does)

- Adds `loading="lazy"` by default (unless `priority` is set).
    
- Automatically calculates `width` and `height` from imported image metadata.
    
- Generates `srcSet` for responsive images.
    
- Serves optimal image formats (e.g., WebP in Chrome).
    

ðŸ“Œ You can verify all of this in:

- **Network tab**: See WebP delivery.
    
- **Elements tab**: See `loading`, `width`, `height`, `srcSet`, etc.
    
- **Console**: Warning about missing `priority` (for important images).

### When to Use `priority`

Use `priority` for images that:

- Appear **above the fold**
    
- Are critical to initial layout
    
- Should not be lazy-loaded
    

```jsx
<Image src={logo} alt="Logo" priority />
```
