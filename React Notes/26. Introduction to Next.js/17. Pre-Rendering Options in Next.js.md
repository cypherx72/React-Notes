Next.js provides two pre-rendering strategies:

1. **Static Generation (SG)**
    
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
    

---

### 1. Static Generation (Recommended)

- Runs **at build time** — during `next build`.
    
- Pre-renders HTML and **includes data** fetched via a special function: `getStaticProps`.
    
- After deployment, the HTML doesn't change unless you rebuild the app.
    
- **Perfect for pages with rarely-changing content** (e.g., blog posts, product pages).
    

---

### `getStaticProps`: Key Concept

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // You can run server-side logic here
  const data = await fetchData(); // e.g., fetch from API, read file system

  return {
    props: {
      someData: data
    }
  };
}
```

- Runs **only on the server**, never exposed to the client.
    
- You can use **file system**, connect to databases, call APIs.
    
- Must return an object with a `props` key.
    
- These `props` are passed into the component during build time.
    

---

### Component File Example

```js
function HomePage(props) {
  return <MeetupList meetups={props.meetups} />;
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      meetups: DUMMY_MEETUPS
    }
  };
}

export default HomePage;
```

- No `useEffect`, no client-side data fetching.
    
- The page is rendered with **all data available upfront**.
    
- HTML contains the **complete content**, improving SEO.
    

---

### Summary: Why Use `getStaticProps`?

✅ Ideal for SEO  
✅ Faster page load  
✅ Safe: never exposed to users  
✅ Runs **during build**, not per request  
✅ Frees you from client-side data fetching

---


### 🔧 What happens when you run `npm run build`?

- Next.js **pre-generates** your pages.
    
- Any page using `getStaticProps` is generated **at build time** as HTML + JSON.
    
- This is called **Static Site Generation (SSG)**.
    

### ✅ Output from the build:

You’ll see:

- ✅ `/` – root page with data from `getStaticProps` (filled dot)
    
- ⚪ `/new-meetup` – static page with no data fetching (empty dot)
    
- ⚪ `/[meetupId]` – dynamic route not yet using `getStaticProps`
    
- ⚪ 404 page – auto-generated
    

### 🔄 The Problem with Static Generation

- The data is **frozen at build time**.
    
- If your database updates (e.g., a new meetup is added), the static page won’t know unless you **rebuild and redeploy**.
    

### 💡 The Fix: `revalidate`

To solve this without constant redeploys, use:

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      meetups: DUMMY_DATA
    },
    revalidate: 10  // Rebuild this page every 10 seconds (if requested)
  };
}
```

This enables **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**:

- After the initial build, Next.js will **regenerate** this page **on the server** every `x` seconds (here, 10) **when there's a request**.
    
- Users always get pages with data that's at most 10 seconds old.
    

### 🔁 Choose `revalidate` based on your use case:

|Data Change Frequency|`revalidate` Value|
|---|---|
|Rarely (e.g., blogs)|3600 or more (1 hr+)|
|Often (e.g., comments)|10 or even 1|

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- `getStaticProps` generates HTML at **build time**.
    
- By default, that HTML **never changes** unless you rebuild.
    
- Use `revalidate` to enable **automatic updates** without full redeploys.
    
- Great for performance **and** up-to-date content.

## ✅ `getStaticProps` – Static Site Generation (SSG)

### What it does:

- **Runs at build time**.
    
- Pre-generates HTML for a page with data.
    
- Used for **faster loading** and **better SEO**.
    
- HTML is served from a CDN – extremely fast.
    

### When to use:

- The page **doesn’t change often** (e.g., blog posts, product pages).
    
- You **don’t need access to the request/response** objects.
    
- You want to **fetch data once** during build and reuse it.
    

### Syntax:

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // fetch data
  return {
    props: {
      yourData: data
    },
    revalidate: 10  // (optional) ISR: Rebuild every X seconds after deployment
  }
}
```

### `revalidate` (Incremental Static Regeneration):

- Keeps static pages **fresh after deployment**.
    
- Regenerates the page on the server **in the background** after a request, if X seconds have passed.
    
- Great middle ground: fast and updated data.
    

---

## 🔁 `getServerSideProps` – Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

### What it does:

- Runs **for every request** after deployment.
    
- Always returns fresh data.
    
- Cannot be cached in advance like `getStaticProps`.
    

### When to use:

- Data **must be always up-to-date** (changes every few seconds).
    
- You need access to the **request object** (e.g., cookies, headers, sessions).
    
- Use it for **auth-protected pages** or **highly dynamic data**.
    

### Syntax:

```js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // You can access req, res from context
  return {
    props: {
      yourData: data
    }
  }
}
```

### Trade-off:

- Slower than `getStaticProps`.
    
- Always waiting for the server to generate the page.
    

---

## 🧠 Which One Should You Use?

|Scenario|Use|
|---|---|
|Content is mostly static (e.g., blog)|`getStaticProps`|
|Data changes occasionally|`getStaticProps` + `revalidate`|
|Real-time updates or user-specific data|`getServerSideProps`|
|Need access to `req` (auth, headers, etc.)|`getServerSideProps`|

---

## Summary

- `getStaticProps` = fast, CDN-delivered pages. Great for public, mostly-static content.
    
- `revalidate` = dynamic-enough, but still fast.
    
- `getServerSideProps` = dynamic, always fresh, but slower. Use only when necessary.

### `getStaticPaths` in Next.js

---

#### 📌 Purpose

`getStaticPaths` is used **alongside `getStaticProps`** in dynamic pages to **define which paths (i.e., dynamic route values) should be pre-rendered at build time**.

---

#### 🔧 When to Use It

- Only when:
    
    - You're using `getStaticProps`
        
    - The page is **dynamic** (e.g., `[id].js`)
        
- **Not needed** with `getServerSideProps`
    

---

#### ⚙️ How It Works

Since `getStaticProps` runs at build time, Next.js must know **which dynamic paths to generate**.  
`getStaticPaths` returns:

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [
      { params: { meetupId: 'm1' } },
      { params: { meetupId: 'm2' } },
    ],
    fallback: false
  };
}
```

---

#### 📁 Returned Object

- `paths`: array of objects, each representing a route.
    
    - Each object: `{ params: { [paramName]: value } }`
        
- `fallback`: tells Next.js what to do if a path is missing.
    

---

#### 🧭 Fallback Options

|Value|Behavior|
|---|---|
|`false`|Only pre-defined paths are allowed. Others show 404.|
|`true`|Missing paths are generated on-demand. Spinner/loading fallback needed.|
|`'blocking'`|Waits for the page to be generated before serving — no spinner needed.|

---

#### 🔒 Example

For a dynamic route file `pages/meetups/[meetupId].js`:

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [
      { params: { meetupId: 'm1' } },
      { params: { meetupId: 'm2' } },
    ],
    fallback: false
  };
}
```

```js
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const meetupId = context.params.meetupId;
  // fetch data based on meetupId
  return {
    props: {
      meetupData: { id: meetupId, title: "Dummy Meetup" }
    }
  };
}
```

---

#### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Use `getStaticPaths` **only with dynamic routes using `getStaticProps`**.
    
- It's essential for static generation — so Next.js knows which dynamic routes to build.
    
- Combine it with `fallback` to control how unlisted paths are handled.
    

---

## `getStaticPaths` & `getStaticProps` for Dynamic Pages

- **When you use `getStaticProps` on a dynamic route**, you must also export `getStaticPaths`.
    
- **Why?** Because `getStaticProps` pre-generates pages during **build time**, so Next.js needs to know _all_ possible dynamic paths (like IDs) in advance.
    

### Key Structure:

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [
      { params: { meetupId: 'm1' } },
      { params: { meetupId: 'm2' } }
    ],
    fallback: false
  };
}
```

### Breakdown:

- `paths`: Array of objects for each dynamic segment (i.e., each `meetupId`).
    
- Each object: `{ params: { meetupId: 'some-id' } }`
    
- `fallback`:
    
    - `false`: Only paths listed will work; others return 404.
        
    - `true`: Next.js will generate unlisted pages on-demand.
        
    - Useful for pre-generating popular pages and dynamically generating less common ones.
