- **The `app/` Folder**:  
    This is the core of a modern Next.js project. It defines your application's routes and page structure.
    
    - Each folder inside `app/` represents a route.
        
    - Special files like `page.js` and `layout.js` define the content and layout of each route.
        
- **`page.js`**:
    
    - Reserved filename.
        
    - Contains a standard React component.
        
    - Treated as a **server component** by default in Next.js.
        
- **What‚Äôs a Server Component?**
    
    - A component rendered on the server (Node.js), not in the browser.
        
    - If you use `console.log("executing")` inside `page.js`, it won‚Äôt appear in the browser‚Äôs developer console.
        
    - Instead, the message shows up in the **terminal** where the Next.js dev server is running.
        
- **Why This Matters**:
    
    - The JSX returned from the server component is converted into static HTML and sent to the client.
        
    - This improves performance and SEO since the content is pre-rendered on the server.
        
- **Key Takeaway**:
    
    - Even though it looks like a typical React component, it behaves differently under the hood due to server-side rendering in Next.js.




- **Purpose of `layout.js`**:
    
    - Acts as a **wrapper** or **shell** for one or more pages.
        
    - Every Next.js app **requires a root `layout.js` file** inside the `/app` directory.
        
    - You can also define **nested layouts** for specific routes (e.g., an `/about/layout.js` that only affects pages under `/about`).
        
- **What It Does**:
    
    - Defines the **HTML skeleton** (like `<html>`, `<body>`) for the application.
        
    - Accepts and uses the **`children` prop** to inject page-specific content.
        
    - This way, each page (from `page.js`) is **injected inside the layout**.
        
- **Why You Use `html` and `body` in Layout**:
    
    - Unlike typical React apps, the **root layout** should include these tags to set up the overall document structure.
        
    - It‚Äôs the only place you directly use these tags in a React component in a Next.js app.
        
- **How Metadata is Handled**:
    
    - You don't use a traditional `<head>` tag manually.
        
    - Instead, you export a reserved constant called `metadata` from your layout file:
        
        ```js
        export const metadata = {
          title: 'Home Page',
          description: 'Welcome to the homepage of our Next.js app.',
        };
        ```
        
    - This is Next.js's way of managing dynamic head content (like title, meta tags, etc.).
        
- **Interaction Between Layout and Page**:
    
    - `layout.js`: Provides the **frame** (navbar, footer, etc.)
        
    - `page.js`: Provides the **content** for a specific route.
        
    - The `children` in `layout.js` represents the **currently active page‚Äôs content**, injected based on the route.
        


#### üß© Nested Layouts 

- You **can** create additional `layout.js` files in subfolders (e.g., `/meals/layout.js`) to **wrap specific pages**.
    
- These **nested layouts** are **embedded** within the root layout.
    
- Layouts use the special `children` prop to render nested pages/layouts.
    

```jsx
export default function MealsLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <p>Meals layout</p>
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
```

- In the example above, `/meals` routes would show the ‚ÄúMeals layout‚Äù text, while the root layout remains active (e.g., SVG still renders).
