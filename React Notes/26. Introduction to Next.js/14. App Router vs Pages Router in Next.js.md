### 🧭 What You’ve Learned So Far

You’ve been working with the **App Router**, which is:

- The **modern and recommended** approach.
    
- Supports **server components**, **layouts**, **metadata**, **nested routing**, and **loading/error UI** out of the box.
    
- Enables **cleaner and more scalable architecture** for full-stack apps.

### 📜 What’s the Pages Router?

The **Pages Router** is:

- The **original routing system** in Next.js (`pages/` folder).
    
- Still **widely used** in existing projects.
    
- Sometimes **more stable** due to long-term community adoption.
    
- Uses client-side data fetching (`getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, etc.).
    
- No server components — everything is a React component.

### 📂 Key Structural Difference

|Feature|App Router (`app/`)|Pages Router (`pages/`)|
|---|---|---|
|Routing|File-based, nested via folders|File-based, flat structure|
|Data Fetching|`async` components, `fetch()`|`getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`|
|Metadata|`metadata` export or `generateMetadata()`|NextHead component|
|Layouts|Nested layout files|Custom layout via `_app.js`|
|Server Components|✅ Supported|❌ Not Supported|

---

### 🔮 Which One Should You Use?

|Use Case|Recommendation|
|---|---|
|Starting a new project|✅ Use **App Router**|
|Working on an older codebase|🛠️ Stick with **Pages Router**|
|Need server components or nested layouts|✅ Go with **App Router**|
|Want more stability for now|✅ Pages Router is still solid|

---

### 📚 Good to Know

- You can **switch between** App and Pages Router in the official docs.
    
- Knowing **both** gives you **versatility**, especially when joining existing teams.
    
- App Router is the **future**, so if you’re learning Next.js now, you’re already ahead.

**Setting Up a Next.js Project with the Pages Router**


### 🚀 How to Create a Pages Router-Based Next.js App

Although the **App Router** is the default and recommended option now, you **can still use the Pages Router** by opting out of the new structure when creating a project.

Here’s how to set up your project:

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the folder where you want to create your project.
    
2. Run the command:
    

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```


### 📁 What You’ll See in Your Project

After setup, your project folder should contain:

- `pages/` → 🧭 All routes live here (each `.js` file = a route)
    
- `public/` → 🌐 Static assets like images, icons, etc.
    
- `styles/` → 🎨 CSS files (`globals.css`, `Home.module.css`)
    
- `next.config.js` → ⚙️ Next.js config file
    
- `package.json` → 📦 Project dependencies and scripts
