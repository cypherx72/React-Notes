**🚀 Programmatic Navigation with `useRouter` – Show Details Button**

Instead of using a `<Link>` component, we can navigate **programmatically** using the `useRouter` hook from `next/router`. This is especially useful when:

- Submitting a form then redirecting
    
- Conditionally navigating
    
- Using buttons instead of links
    

**📌 Setup Steps:**

1. **Import `useRouter`:**
    

```js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
```

2. **Get the router object:** React hooks must be called at the top level of the component.
    

```js
const router = useRouter();
```

3. **Create a handler function:**
    

```js
function showDetailsHandler() {
  router.push(`/${props.id}`);
}
```

4. **Attach to a button:**
    

```jsx
<button onClick={showDetailsHandler}>Show Details</button>
```

This navigates to a dynamic route like `/m1`, `/m2`, etc., using the `id` passed as a prop.

**📝 Note:**

- Using `<Link>` would be more semantic for navigation, but this approach is ideal when navigation is tied to a user action (like form submission or button click).



## Fetching Data After Component Mount (useEffect) – Drawbacks in Next.js

---

### 🛠️ Current Setup

- **Dummy data** (`DUMMY_MEETUPS`) is hard-coded into the component.
    
- In `index.js`, we pass this data directly into props.
    

---

### 🧠 Simulating Backend Fetching

To simulate fetching from a backend:

- Use the `useEffect` hook to trigger data fetching **after component mounts**.
    
- Manage fetched data using the `useState` hook.
    

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

useEffect(() => {
  // simulate HTTP request
  setLoadedMeetups(DUMMY_MEETUPS); // pretend this came from a server
}, []);
```

---

### ⚙️ What Happens Internally

1. **First Render Cycle**:
    
    - `loadedMeetups` is initially an **empty array**.
        
2. **After `useEffect` Runs**:
    
    - State is updated → component re-renders → now `loadedMeetups` contains data.
        

---

### ❗ The Problem: SEO & Pre-rendering

- **Next.js only pre-renders** the output of the **first render cycle**.
    
- Since `loadedMeetups` is empty during the first cycle:
    
    - The server-rendered HTML has **no actual content**.
        
    - HTML source shows an empty list → **SEO suffers**.
        
- Even if data is available instantly, this gap still exists due to how `useEffect` is executed.
    

---

### 💡 Why This Matters

- Good SEO requires that the HTML **already contains the content**.
    
- With client-side data fetching (`useEffect`), HTML is empty at first → bad for SEO, bots, or preview snippets.
    

---

**Static Generation and `getStaticProps` in Next.js**

Next.js supports **built-in page pre-rendering**, which means it generates HTML for each page in advance instead of doing it entirely on the client-side. This improves performance and SEO. But there's a **catch**:

- Pre-rendered pages reflect the **initial render cycle** of the React component.
    
- This means **dynamic data fetched via `useEffect` isn't included** in the HTML sent to the client.
    
- So the first request might serve an **incomplete snapshot** — good for SEO _in theory_, but not always in practice.
    

---

### Hydration and the React Takeover

After this static HTML is sent:

- React hydrates the page (i.e., **attaches event listeners**, makes it interactive).
    
- Then `useEffect` runs and data is fetched **client-side**, updating the UI.
    
- This transition turns the page into a **Single Page Application (SPA)**.
    

But what if you want **fully loaded data** already present in the HTML sent from the server?
