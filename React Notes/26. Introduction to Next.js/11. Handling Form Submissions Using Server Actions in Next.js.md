### üîß Problem:

How do we handle form submissions in a Next.js full-stack app without manually collecting form data and making a fetch/axios call?

---

### ‚úÖ Solution: **Use Server Actions**

Instead of the traditional React way (using `onSubmit`, `preventDefault()`, and sending data manually to the backend), Next.js provides **Server Actions**‚Äîa more powerful and elegant solution when working in a full-stack environment.

---

### üß† Key Concepts:

#### 1. **Create a Server Action**

- Define an async function inside the component that contains the form.
    
- Add the directive `'use server'` **inside** the function body.
    

```js
async function shareMeal(formData) {
  'use server';
  // handle form data
}
```

#### 2. **Assign it to the `action` prop of the `<form>`**

```js
<form action={shareMeal}>
  <!-- form inputs -->
</form>
```

- This is not typical HTML behavior (where `action` is a URL)‚ÄîNext.js hijacks this and directly invokes the function on the server.
    

---

### üì• How Form Data Works:

- `formData` is passed automatically to the server action function.
    
- Use `formData.get('field_name')` to extract values.
    

```js
const meal = {
  title: formData.get('title'),
  summary: formData.get('summary'),
  instructions: formData.get('instructions'),
  image: formData.get('image'), // uploaded file
  creator: formData.get('name'),
  creator_email: formData.get('email'),
};
```

---

### üñºÔ∏è Handling Custom Components (like ImagePicker):

- Make sure to pass a `name` prop to custom components that are part of the form.
    

```jsx
<ImagePicker label="Your image" name="image" />
```

---

### üì¶ Behavior:

- No manual `preventDefault` is required.
    
- Page doesn't reload.
    
- Data is logged on the **server**, not in browser dev tools.
    

---

### üîÑ What Happens Under the Hood:

- Next.js serializes the form data and sends a request to the server.
    
- The `Server Action` is triggered on the backend.
    
- Input values and files are available via the `formData` object.
    

---

### üìù Testing:

1. Enter data in the form.
    
2. Pick an image.
    
3. Submit the form.
    
4. Check your terminal for the log (not browser console).

# Server Actions: Externalizing Logic for Flexibility

## Key Concept: Server Actions Outside Component Files

- **Problem**: You **cannot define Server Actions in client components**. If the file uses `"use client"` (e.g., for `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.), you'll get an error if it contains a server action.
    
- **Reason**: Mixing server and client logic in the same file causes issues during the build process. It risks exposing secure logic to the client and creates technical conflicts.
    

---

## Solution: Define Server Actions in Separate Files

1. **Create a standalone file** (e.g., `lib/actions.js`).
    
2. Add `'use server'` **at the top of the file**, not inside functions.
    
3. All functions in this file will be treated as **Server Actions**.
    
4. Export your server action (e.g., `export async function shareMeal(formData) { ... }`).
    
5. **Remove** `'use server'` from the function body‚Äîit's already at the top of the file.
    

---

## How to Use in Components

- Import the function into your component:
    
    ```js
    import { shareMeal } from '@/lib/actions';
    ```
    
- Then pass it directly to your form:
    
    ```jsx
    <form action={shareMeal}>
      {/* form fields */}
    </form>
    ```
    

---

## Benefits

- Clean separation of concerns (UI vs server logic).
    
- Allows client components (`"use client"`) to still use server logic safely.
    
- Supports **better scalability and maintainability** of your codebase.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è The Danger of User Input in HTML (XSS Attack Risk)

## üö® Problem: Rendering User Input with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

In the `MealDetailPage`, user-generated instructions are displayed as **HTML**, for example:

```jsx
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: meal.instructions }} />
```

This is needed to allow formatting (like `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<strong>`, etc.) in the instructions.

**But here's the problem:**

If a user submits this:

```html
<p>Step 1: Cook rice</p><script>alert("Hacked!")</script>
```

Then the browser **executes the `<script>`**, and a malicious attacker can:

- Steal cookies
    
- Log keystrokes
    
- Redirect users to phishing pages
    
- Execute arbitrary JavaScript
    

This is a **classic XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** vulnerability.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Sanitize User Input Before Storing

Instead of trusting user input blindly, **sanitize** it before saving.

### üõ† Step 1: Install Security Package

```bash
npm install xss
```

### üßº Step 2: Sanitize `instructions`

```js
import xss from 'xss';

meal.instructions = xss(meal.instructions);
```

This removes any harmful scripts but keeps safe formatting tags (like `<p>`, `<strong>`, etc.).

---

## üåê Also Needed: Slugify for Clean URLs

While fixing security, we also clean the `title` for URL use:

```bash
npm install slugify
```

Then generate the slug like this:

```js
import slugify from 'slugify';

meal.slug = slugify(meal.title, { lower: true });
```

---

## üß© Final Function (Partial)

In `meals.js`:

```js
import slugify from 'slugify';
import xss from 'xss';

export async function saveMeal(meal) {
  meal.slug = slugify(meal.title, { lower: true });
  meal.instructions = xss(meal.instructions);

  // Save meal to DB and handle image (next step)
}
```

Enhancing Form UX with `useFormStatus`

To improve user experience during form submissions (e.g., meal submissions), we can provide real-time UI feedback using the `useFormStatus` hook from `react-dom`.

---

#### ‚úÖ Goal:

Give users visual feedback (e.g., "Submitting...") while a form is being processed, without converting the whole page to a client component.

---

#### üîß `useFormStatus` Overview:

- **Import from:** `react-dom` (not `react` or `next`)
    
- **Purpose:** Tracks the pending state of a form submission.
    
- **Returns:** `{ pending: boolean, ... }`
    
- **Constraint:** Must be used inside the form it‚Äôs tracking.
    
- **Requires:** `use client` directive (must be used in a client component).
    

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas:

- `useFormStatus` must be **used within** the form component it tracks.
    
- Avoid wrapping the entire page with `use client` just for button feedback.
    
- Instead, extract the button into its **own client component**.
    

---

#### üõ† Steps to Implement:

1. **Create a new client component**: `MealsFormSubmit.jsx`
    
2. **Use `useFormStatus` inside it**.
    
3. **Conditionally render the button label**:
    
    - `Submitting` if `pending === true`
        
    - `Share Meal` otherwise
        
4. **Disable button** during submission with `disabled={pending}`
    

```jsx
'use client'

import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom'

export default function MealsFormSubmit() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus()

  return (
    <button disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Share Meal'}
    </button>
  )
}
```

---

#### üîÅ Update Form:

Replace the regular `<button>` in the form with `<MealsFormSubmit />`.

---

#### üéØ Result:

- Button now shows **"Submitting..."** while request is being processed.
    
- Prevents duplicate submissions with `disabled` prop.
    
- No need to convert entire page to a client component.
    

**Validating Form Data on the Server in Next.js**


#### ‚úÖ Why Server-Side Validation is Necessary:

- Client-side validations (`required`, `type="email"`, etc.) can **easily be bypassed** via DevTools.
    
- Server validation ensures **only valid data reaches the database or backend logic**.
    
- Critical for **security, data integrity, and maintaining consistent app behavior**.
    

---

### üõ† Server-Side Validation Strategy:

#### 1. **Helper Function: `isInvalidText`**

Checks for falsy or empty strings after trimming.

```js
function isInvalidText(text) {
  return !text || text.trim() === '';
}
```

---

#### 2. **Validation Checks in Server Action:**

Check the following fields:

```js
if (
  isInvalidText(meal.title) ||
  isInvalidText(meal.summary) ||
  isInvalidText(meal.instructions) ||
  isInvalidText(meal.creator) ||
  isInvalidText(meal.creator_email) ||
  !meal.creator_email.includes('@') ||
  !meal.image || meal.image.size === 0
) {
  throw new Error("Invalid input");
}
```

- **Title, Summary, Instructions, Creator, Email**: Required and must not be blank.
    
- **Email**: Must contain an `@` symbol.
    
- **Image**: Must exist and have a size greater than zero.
    

---

### üî• Current Drawback:

Throwing an error this way triggers a full page crash (e.g., generic error page).

> ‚ùå Bad UX: All previously entered user data is lost.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution Preview (for next step):

- Instead of `throw`, **stay on the same page**.
    
- Show error messages **inline (above or below the form)**.
    
- Improve form resiliency and keep user input intact when errors happen.
    

### üìÑ Topic: Server-side Form Validation and Error Handling in Server Actions

---

### ‚úÖ **Why Client-Side Validation Isn't Enough**

- **Client-side HTML5 validation** (`required` attributes) is helpful but can be bypassed using browser DevTools.
    
- Malicious or savvy users can remove these restrictions and send invalid data.
    
- **Always validate on the server** to ensure data integrity and security.
    

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Implementing Server-side Validation**

Create a **helper function**:

```js
function isInvalidText(text) {
  return !text || text.trim() === '';
}
```

Validate each form field:

```js
if (
  isInvalidText(meal.title) ||
  isInvalidText(meal.summary) ||
  isInvalidText(meal.instructions) ||
  isInvalidText(meal.creator) ||
  isInvalidText(meal.creator_email) ||
  !meal.creator_email.includes('@') ||
  !meal.image || meal.image.size === 0
) {
  throw new Error('Invalid input');
}
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problems with Throwing Errors**

- Throwing an error **reloads the page** and **loses all user input**.
    
- Not a great user experience‚Äîespecially frustrating on large forms.
    

---

### üí° **Better Approach: Return a Response**

Instead of throwing errors, return a **serializable response object**:

```js
return { message: 'Invalid input' };
```

This keeps the user on the same page and lets you show a relevant message without clearing the form.

---

### üîÅ **useFormState Hook for Handling Server Responses**

#### Step-by-step Setup:

1. **Import and use useFormState**:
    

```js
import { useFormState } from 'react-dom';

const [state, formAction] = useFormState(shareMeal, { message: null });
```

2. **Replace action handler** in the form:
    

```jsx
<form action={formAction}>
```

3. **Display error message in the form**:
    

```jsx
{state.message && <p className="text-red-600">{state.message}</p>}
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Update the Server Action Function Signature**

Because `useFormState` passes:

- First argument: Previous state
    
- Second argument: Form data
    

Update the function:

```js
async function shareMeal(prevState, formData) {
  // Access form data with formData.get('fieldname')
}
```

---

### üí° **Important Tips**

- `useFormState` only works in **client components**.
    
    - Add `'use client'` at the top of your component.
        
- The response object shape is **completely customizable** (just keep it serializable).
    
- You can later expand this to return **field-specific error messages** for better UX.
    

---

### üîö Summary

- Validate all form inputs on the server.
    
- Return error messages instead of throwing them.
    
- Use `useFormState` to capture those messages and reflect them in the UI.
    
- This approach gives users immediate feedback without losing their input‚Äîclean and modern UX.
    

**Alternative Approach** 

**`useFormState()`**
    
    - Alternative to `useFormStatus`.
        
    - Accepts:
        
        - First arg: server action (`shareMeal`)
            
        - Second arg: initial state (e.g., `{ message: null }`)
            
    - Returns:
        
        - `[state, formAction]`
            
        - `formAction` is used as the form's `action`
            
        - `state` is the current or last response object
            
- **Server Action Return Shape**
    
    - Must be a **serializable object** (no functions)
        
    - Can return structured data like `{ message: "Invalid input" }`
        
- **Client Component Requirement**
    
    - `useFormState` needs to be in a client component
        
    - Add `'use client'` at the top of the file
