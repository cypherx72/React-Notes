### 🔧 **Setup & Pre-requisites**

- ✅ Use **environment variables** (for real apps) to store credentials securely.
    
- ❗In this demo, credentials are hard-coded **only for simplicity**. It’s fine because this code **won’t be exposed to the client**.

### ☁️ **Why Vercel?**

- Created by the same team as **Next.js** → fully optimized.
    
- Handles **build**, **deployment**, and **hosting** seamlessly.
    
- Vercel auto-runs `npm run build` on deployment.

### 🔗 **Before Deploying**

1. **Push project to GitHub**:
    
    - Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
        
    - Initialize repo:
        
        ```bash
        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
        ```
        
    - Connect remote:
        
        ```bash
        git remote add origin <repo-url>
        git push --all
        ```
        
    - Authenticate using **GitHub token** (from GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens).

### 🚀 **Deploy to Vercel**

1. Sign into [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and link GitHub.
    
2. Choose your repository.
    
3. Accept default **Next.js** project settings.
    
4. Click **Deploy**.
    
    - Vercel auto-detects Next.js and runs `npm run build`.

### ☁️ **MongoDB Atlas Configuration**

- Go to **Network Access**.
    
- Add IP **0.0.0.0/0** to allow access from any server.
    
- ⚠️ Must be done **before** or **during** deployment, or deployment may fail.
    

---

### 🛠️ **What Happens Under the Hood**

- `npm run build`:
    
    - Pre-generates static pages (SSG).
        
    - Creates `.next` folder with optimized files.
        
- `npm start`:
    
    - Launches production server (only needed for custom hosting, not on Vercel).
        

---

### ✅ **Post-Deployment Testing**

- Visit Vercel link.
    
- Add data (e.g., a meetup).
    
- If data doesn't show immediately:
    
    - The page is **statically generated**.
        
    - Revalidated after 1s (ISR - Incremental Static Regeneration).
        
- **404 error on detail page**?
    
    - It's expected → page is **not pre-rendered yet** or dynamic route setup might be missing.

**Topic: Fixing `getStaticPaths` Fallback Behavior in Next.js**

---

### 🔍 Problem Summary

In the **single meetup page**, the list of paths was defined using `getStaticPaths` with:

```js
fallback: false
```

This meant:

- Only pages _pre-generated at build time_ would be available.
    
- Any _new meetups_ added **after deployment** would **fail** (404 error).
    
- During development, this worked fine since `getStaticPaths` runs on every request.
    

---

### 🛠️ The Fix

**Set `fallback` to `"blocking"`** instead of `false`.

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [...],
    fallback: 'blocking',
  };
}
```

This tells Next.js:

- The list of paths may **not be complete**.
    
- If a requested page **wasn't pre-generated**, generate it **on-demand**.
    
- After generation, the page is **cached** for future visits.
    

---

### ✅ `true` vs `blocking`

|Fallback|Behavior|
|---|---|
|`true`|Shows a fallback (e.g., loading) page first, then loads real content|
|`blocking`|Waits for the page to finish building before showing it to the user|

> **Why use `blocking` here?**  
> It simplifies the code—you don’t need to handle loading states for missing data.

---

### 🚀 Redeployment Steps

To apply this change:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: enable blocking fallback"
git push
```

✅ GitHub triggers automatic redeployment (if connected)  
✅ During redeployment, the **old site remains active**  
✅ After build completes, **new version is live**

---

### 🔄 Aftermath

- Visit the main page → reload to revalidate
    
- Click new meetup → page gets created on-the-fly
    
- New pages will now **work without manual rebuilds**

### 📌 Bonus Tips

- You can connect a **custom domain**
    
- Customize project configs as needed
    
- Explore **more Next.js features** like incremental static regeneration (ISR)
