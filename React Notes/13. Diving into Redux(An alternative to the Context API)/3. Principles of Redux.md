### **1. Setting Up the Project**
- Create an **empty folder** for the project.
- Run `npm init -y` to generate a `package.json` file.
- Install Redux by running:
  ```bash
  npm install redux
  ```

---

### **2. Creating a Redux Store**
- Import Redux in your JavaScript file (e.g., `redux-demo.js`):
  ```javascript
  const redux = require('redux');
  ```
- Create a **store** using `createStore`:
  ```javascript
  const store = redux.createStore(counterReducer);
  ```

---

### **3. Defining the Reducer**
- A **reducer** is a function that takes the **current state** and an **action**, and returns the **new state**.
- Example reducer:
  ```javascript
  const counterReducer = (state = { counter: 0 }, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'INCREMENT':
        return { counter: state.counter + 1 };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };
  ```
- **Key Points**:
  - The reducer must be a **pure function** (no side effects).
  - It should return a **new state object** (immutability).
  - The **initial state** is provided as a default value for the `state` parameter.

---

### **4. Setting Up a Subscription**
- A **subscription** allows components (or other code) to be notified when the state changes.
- Example subscription:
  ```javascript
  const counterSubscriber = () => {
    const latestState = store.getState();
    console.log(latestState);
  };
  ```
- Register the subscription with the store:
  ```javascript
  store.subscribe(counterSubscriber);
  ```

---

### **5. Dispatching Actions**
- **Actions** are plain JavaScript objects with a `type` property (and optionally a `payload`).
- Example action:
  ```javascript
  store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
  ```
- When an action is dispatched:
  - The **reducer** is called with the current state and the action.
  - The reducer returns a **new state**.
  - The store updates its state and notifies all **subscribers**.

---

### **6. Running the Code**
- Execute the file using Node.js:
  ```bash
  node redux-demo.js
  ```
- **Output**:
  - The initial state is logged (e.g., `{ counter: 1 }`).
  - After dispatching an action, the updated state is logged (e.g., `{ counter: 2 }`).

---

### **7. Key Concepts**
1. **Store**:
   - Holds the entire state of the application.
   - Created using `createStore`.
2. **Reducer**:
   - A pure function that updates the state based on actions.
   - Must return a new state object (immutability).
3. **Actions**:
   - Objects that describe what should happen (e.g., `{ type: 'INCREMENT' }`).
   - Dispatched using `store.dispatch(action)`.
4. **Subscriptions**:
   - Notify subscribers when the state changes.
   - Registered using `store.subscribe(subscriber)`.

---

### **8. Common Pitfalls**
- **Initial State**:
  - Always provide a default value for the `state` parameter in the reducer to avoid errors during initialization.
- **Immutability**:
  - Always return a **new state object** in the reducer (do not modify the existing state directly).
- **Action Types**:
  - Use unique and descriptive `type` values for actions (e.g., `'INCREMENT'`, `'DECREMENT'`).

---

### **9. Next Steps**
- Add more actions (e.g., `DECREMENT`, `ADD`, `SUBTRACT`) to the reducer.
- Use **payloads** in actions to pass additional data:
  ```javascript
  store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD', payload: 5 });
  ```
- Explore **Redux Toolkit** for a more modern and simplified Redux setup.
