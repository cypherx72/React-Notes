## 🔥 **Problem Overview**  

- In a React app, state updates in the parent component (e.g., `App`) can trigger **re-renders** in all child components — even when the state is unrelated to the child components.  

- Example:  

    - An `input` field in the `App` component updates state on each keystroke.  

    - This causes **all child components** (e.g., `Counter`, `Header`) to be executed again — even though their state or props didn’t change.    

---  

## 🚀 **Why This is a Problem**

- While the actual **DOM might not change** when React re-executes components, the component functions are still being executed.  

- This consumes **CPU resources** and slows down performance unnecessarily.  

- React re-executes the component function because:  

    - State changed → React re-executes the parent component.  

    - Child components are part of the parent’s JSX → React re-executes them too.

## 🛠️ **Solution 1: `React.memo()`**

- `React.memo()` is a **higher-order component** that prevents unnecessary re-renders by memorizing the output of a component.  

- It wraps a component and **compares the current props with the previous props**:  

    - If the props are **identical** → Skip re-execution of the component.  

    - If the props **changed** → Re-execute the component.  

  
### ✅ **How to Use `memo()`**  

1. **Import `memo`** from React:  

```jsx
import React, { memo } from 'react';
```

2. **Wrap the component** using `memo()`:

```jsx
const Counter = memo(function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  // Component code...
});
```

3. **Best Practice:**  

   - Store the wrapped component in a **constant** and export it:  

```jsx
const Counter = memo(function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  return <div>{initialCount}</div>;
});

export default Counter;
```

## ⚙️ **How `memo()` Works**

- When React would normally re-execute the component, `memo()` does the following:  

    1. Compares **previous prop values** with **new prop values**.  

    2. If the values are exactly the same → **Skip execution**.  

    3. If the values are different → **Re-execute the component**.  

    4. If state inside the component itself changes → `memo()` does **NOT** prevent the execution.  


---

## 📌 **Example**

### Before `memo()`:

1. App re-renders → All child components (`Header`, `Counter`, etc.) re-execute.  

2. Even if `Counter` props are the same → It still executes.  

### After `memo()`:

1. App re-renders.  

2. `memo()` checks props:  

    - If unchanged → Skip execution of `Counter`.  

    - If changed → Execute `Counter` only.

## 🏆 **Best Practices for `memo()`**

✅ Use `memo()` only when:  

- The component re-renders frequently but **props stay unchanged**.  

- The component is **high up** in the component tree → Prevents deeper re-renders.  

- The component is **computationally expensive** to execute.  


❌ Don’t use `memo()` when:  

- Props change **almost every time** → Prop comparison adds overhead.  

- Components are simple → No noticeable performance gain.  

- State inside the component is changing often → `memo()` doesn’t prevent state-based updates.  

  

---

## 🚨 **Why Not to Overuse `memo()`**

- `memo()` adds a small **performance cost** for comparing props.  

- If props change often → You waste CPU checking props instead of just executing the component.  

- Example:  

    - If props always change → `memo()` becomes **a performance bottleneck** instead of an improvement.

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways**  

✅ `memo()` prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing props.  
✅ Best used for **components high up** in the tree.  
✅ Works only for **prop-based** re-renders, not internal state changes.  
✅ Don’t overuse — use it **strategically** for performance gains.
