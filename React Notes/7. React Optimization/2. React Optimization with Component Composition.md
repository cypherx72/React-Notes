## 🔥 **Problem Overview**  

- When state changes in a parent component (`App`), **all child components** are executed — even if the state change is unrelated to some child components.  

- Example:  

    - An input field updates state in the `App` component on every keystroke.  

    - This causes **all components** (like `Counter`, `Header`) to execute unnecessarily.  

---
## 🚀 **Solution 2: Component Composition**  

Instead of using `memo()` to prevent re-renders, you can:  

✅ **Move state management** to a separate child component.  

✅ This ensures that only the child component handling the state change will re-render — not the parent or other unrelated components.  


---
  
## ⚙️ **How Component Composition Fixes the Problem**  

1. Extract the state and logic related to the input field into a **separate child component** (`ConfigureCounter`).  

2. The state that changes frequently (on each keystroke) will now be isolated in the new child component.  

3. The parent (`App`) will **not re-execute** because state changes in a child component **don’t affect the parent**.  

4. When the input is confirmed (e.g., via a button), the child component **lifts state** up to the parent using a prop.

## 🏆 **Why Component Composition Works Better**  

✅ State that updates frequently (e.g., input changes) is now isolated in `ConfigureCounter`.  
✅ Only `ConfigureCounter` re-executes on every keystroke — not the entire `App` component.  
✅ Parent (`App`) and other child components (e.g., `Counter`) stay unaffected unless their state or props change.

## ⚡ **Comparison: `memo()` vs. Component Composition**  

| Technique | How It Works | Best Use Case | Downsides |

|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|

| **`memo()`** | Prevents re-execution if props are unchanged | Prevents unnecessary renders for **static props** | Prop comparison adds overhead |

| **Component Composition** | Moves state to a child component to prevent parent re-renders | Prevents re-renders for **frequently changing state** | Requires restructuring the component tree |


---
  
## 🎯 **Best Practices**  

✅ Use **`memo()`** for:  

- Props that rarely change.  

- Preventing expensive component execution when props don’t change.  


✅ Use **Component Composition** for:  

- State that changes frequently (like form inputs).  

- Avoiding re-execution of the parent component when state changes in a child.

## 🎉 **Key Takeaways**  

✅ State changes in a child component don’t trigger re-renders in the parent.  
✅ Component composition is more efficient than `memo()` for isolating frequent state changes.  
✅ `memo()` is ideal for **static props** and preventing unnecessary re-renders at the **child level**.  
✅ Choose the right optimization technique based on the **type of state and props**!
